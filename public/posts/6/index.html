Whether it&#8217;s trains, queens or lochs, he succeeds in ending his poems with a death theme. Macabre achievements aside, he is right of course about the scenery. It deserves a magnificent poem. Bring it on.</div>

My latest &#8220;week without caffeine&#8221; push has finally finished.<br /><br />As has proven to be the case most times I&#8217;ve done this, day 3 and 4 were the worst, although the ways my body has rebelled have varied. This time, I didn&#8217;t get the migraines that I did the first time I detoxed, but I did have almost constant low-grade dull headaches. On day 4 (Wednesday), I found it almost impossible to focus on anything, felt irritable, restless – it was like I&#8217;d drunk a bottle of red cordial neat. I can&#8217;t imagine what it would be like to have to battle that every single day :S<br /><br />The picture in this post is my tribute to the hot drink that helped me get through the 168 hours of torture: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos">Rooibos</a>. Unlike tea, rooibos is completely caffeine-free, but is still rich in minerals &amp; anti-oxidants. I think it may be in my top 3 hot drinks now (sorry, green tea!), and I expect to be drinking a lot more of it in the future.<br /><br />Okay, now I&#8217;m off for a cuppa, see y&#8217;all later!<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" >Photo Creative Commons: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ravissant74/534058328/">wilnora on flickr</a></span></div>

			Mondays With McGonagall: Peas</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class='post'>
This week&#8217;s Monday with McGonagall comes from his autobiographical writings, and explains his first performance-related encounter with peas…<br /><br /><hr /><br /><blockquote><br /><p><br />My Dearly Beloved Readers, – I will begin with giving an account of my experiences amongst the publicans. Well, I must say that the first man who threw peas at me was a publican, while I was giving an entertainment to a few of my admirers in a public-house in a certain little village not far from Dundee but, my dear friends, I wish it to be understood that the publican who threw the peas at me was not the     landlord of the public-house, he was one of the party who came to hear me give my entertainment.<br /></p><p>Well, my dear readers, it was while I was singing my own song, <i>The Rattling Boy from Dublin Town</i>, that he threw the peas at me. You must understand that the Rattling Boy was courting a lass called Biddy Brown, and the Rattling Boy chanced to meet his Biddy one night in company with another lad called Barney Magee, which, of course, he did not like to see, and he told Biddy he considered it too bad for her to be going about with another lad, and he would bid her good-bye for being untrue to him. Then Barney Magee told the Rattling Boy that Biddy Brown was his lass, and that he could easily find another – and come and have a glass, and be friends. </p><p>But the Rattling Boy told Barney Magee to give his glass of strong drink to the devil! meaning, I suppose, it was only fit for devils to make use of, not for God&#8217;s creatures. Because, my friends, too often has strong drink been the cause of seducing many a beautiful young woman away from her true lover, and from her parents also, by a false seducer which, no doubt, the Rattling Boy considered Barney Magee to be.</p><p> Therefore, my dear friends, the reason, I think, for the publican throwing the peas at me is because I say, to the devil with your glass, in my song, <i>The Rattling Boy from Dublin</i>, and he, no doubt, considered it had a teetotal tendency about it, and, for that reason, he had felt angry, and had thrown the peas at me.</p></blockquote></div>

A Rattling Boy? So he makes a sound like a rattle? No wonder Biddy hit the bottle.</div>

Unfortunately, my love for caffeinated goodness often means my consumption goes up in direct proportion to my busyness levels, until I find myself drinking too much of the stuff.<br /><br />Not being the sort of person that&#8217;s really capable of doing anything by halves (including coffee drinking), I combat this by going on caffeine fasts, where I&#8217;ll not drink anything caffeinated for a period of time (usually a week). As I sit here with a nearly-empty thermos of plunger coffee, I can&#8217;t help but think that it&#8217;s time for another one.<br /><br />So as of midnight tonight, I&#8217;ll be completely off caffeine (in any form: tea, coffee, chocolate, energy drinks, whatever) for the entire week. Usually by day 3, my body goes into full-scale rebellion, and tries to make life miserable. Thankfully there aren&#8217;t any uni classes this week.<br /><br />Wish me luck…<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarandweedkiller/1118758309/"><span style="font-size:78%;"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Photo Creative Commons: </span></span></a><span class="nickname"><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarandweedkiller/1118758309/"><span style="font-size:78%;">GIRLintheCAFE on Flickr</span></a><br /></span></div>

I too am dancing at the door of caffeine&#8217;s hold. Not one week passes by without a cup of Earl Grey. It&#8217;s going to take me some time to finish the best price-per-unit purchase of a box of 100 tea bags.<BR/><BR/>Good luck.</div>

As a proud bearer of a Scottish name, I thought it only fitting to use today to start something I&#8217;d been meaning to do for some time.<br /><br />It is my endeavour to post weekly excerpts of the works of William Topaz McGonagall, widely hailed as Scotland&#8217;s (and possibly the world&#8217;s) worst poet. I think that his work is greatly underappreciated, and if through this blog I can introduce more people to his magic, then I will be satisfied.<br /><br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the great bard, here is an excerpt from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Topaz_McGonagall" title="William Topaz McGonagall on Wikipedia">his entry on Wikipedia</a>:<br /><blockquote><br />Born in Edinburgh, of Irish parentage, McGonagall was working as a handloom weaver in Dundee, Scotland when an event occurred that was to change his life. As he was later to write: <dl><dd><i>The most startling incident in my life was the time I discovered myself to be a poet, which was in the year 1877.</i></dd></dl> <p>It was with this that he wrote his first poem <i>An Address to the Rev. George Gilfillan</i>, which showed all the hallmarks that would characterise his later work. Gilfillan commented &#8220;Shakespeare never wrote anything like this.&#8221;</p> <p>McGonagall has been widely acclaimed as the worst poet in British history. The chief criticisms of his poetry are that he is deaf to poetic metaphor and unable to scan correctly. In the hands of lesser artists, this might simply generate dull, uninspiring verse. However, McGonagall&#8217;s fame stems from the humorous effects these shortcomings generate. The inappropriate rhythms, weak vocabulary, and ill-advised imagery combine to make his work amongst the most spontaneously amusing comic poetry in the English language.</p></blockquote><hr /><br />Here, then, is the inaugural Monday with McGonagall (albeit incorrectly, and somehow appropriately, on a Tuesday):<br /><span style="font-size:130%;"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">A Requisition to the Queen</span></span><br /><div class="poem"><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:georgia;" name="KonaFilter" >Most August!

…I will be back in Adelaide for the first time since I left there at the end of 2008. I&#8217;ll be there for the Equip Conference, a Christian training event run by the <a href="http://efac.org.au/">Evangelical Fellowship of Anglican Churches</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;m a little apprehensive about going back, as coming back to Melbourne from overseas made me feel almost as if I&#8217;d never left (being so busy didn&#8217;t hurt, either, of course :) I don&#8217;t know why this suddenly comes at me; it happened just before I left Adelaide to come back to Melbourne after Christmas.<br /><br />Whatever the case, it&#8217;s bound to be a valuable weekend of sound teaching and great training, and a chance to see some old new friends for the first time in a while :)</div>

You&#8217;re committed to finding joy in everything that the Lord shows you and takes you through, even if it doesn&#8217;t fit with the plans you&#8217;ve supposedly laid down.<br /><br />The biggest struggle, then, is to keep from second-guessing. It really reminds me of the Israelites – they&#8217;d seen God&#8217;s amazing hand in delivering them from slavery in Egypt. They&#8217;d seen plagues, miracles, and signs worthy of being passed down through the generations as examples of God&#8217;s power and faithfulness  – but as soon as things got a little hard? They wanted their &#8220;control&#8221; back, to feel like they were in charge. They needed constant reminders (and more than a little discipline) to remind them of Who they depended on for their very existence.<br /><br />My prayer is to be able to echo these words of Chris Tomlin:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />All of You is more than enough for all of me<br />For every thirst and every need<br />You satisfy me with Your love<br />And all I have in You is more than enough<br /><br />You are my supply<br />My breath of life<br />And still more awesome than I know<br />You are my reward<br />worth living for<br />And still more awesome than I know<br /><br />All of You is more than enough for all of me<br />For every thirst and every need<br />You satisfy me with Your love<br />And all I have in You is more than enough<br /><br />You&#8217;re my sacrifice<br />Of greatest price<br />And still more awesome than I know<br />You&#8217;re the coming King<br />You are everything<br />And still more awesome than I know<br /><br />More than all I want<br />More than all I need<br />You are more than enough for me<br />More than all I know<br />More than all I can say<br />You are more than enough for me<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><hr/><br />Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96dpi/2241923654/in/set-72157600446937074/">96dpi on flickr</a></div>

This reminds me of how I felt going back to Uni to study law after living in Africa. The value systems here clashed with the way that I had learned to live. I struggled with the contradictions for a few years. Thankfully, as you said about the Israelites, God keeps reminding us of what we once knew. Truth can get buried in a grave&#8230;but it won&#8217;t stay there.</div>

One of the things I&#8217;m doing as part of my involvement with <a href="http://www.swinburnecu.org/">Swinburne Christian Union</a> this year is co-leading a Bible Study on Monday mornings. I hope to post a more fleshed-out version of what I&#8217;ll be going through each fortnight on the Monday or Tuesday after I&#8217;ve taken the study. First one is this week, hope it goes smoothly.<br /><br />Now, to actually finish writing it…</div>

That&#8217;s ok, more learning curve. I&#8217;m hoping that having everything hosted and managed for me will make it easier for me to just write, and ignore all the fiddle.<br /><br />We&#8217;ll see how it goes…<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">(Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fraumorgenstern/2407468929/" alt="fraumorgenstern on flickr">fraumorgenstern on flickr</a>)<br /></div><div style="text-align: right;"><br /></div></div>

Was going to ask you which one that was – there seem to be a few around, of varying usefulness. Same applies to your flickr feed box. Maybe you can let me know which ones they are offline?</div>

Good to see you in this corner of the tubes! I look forward to more.<BR/><BR/>The twitter syndication ad-on is a useful way to keep things from getting stagnant.</div>
