These purport to tell you which Pride &amp; Prejudice character you are, or (if you&#8217;re of the female persuasion) which Austen hero you &#8220;get&#8221;.<br /><br />Quite a number of my female facebook friends expressed disappointment that they didn&#8217;t get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzwilliam_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</a> as their companion of choice. One expression of annoyance in particular caught my eye – my friend had the result of Mr Bingley, the affable companion of Mr Darcy&#8217;s. Her response? &#8220;Slightly dissatisfied&#8221;!<br /><br />I&#8217;m surprised that Bingley gets passed over so much in favour of Darcy; there are no real flaws in his character, apart from considering others&#8217; opinions too highly. His heart is in the right place, and he never treats any of the other characters with anything other than genuine friendship and affection (something almost every other character is singularly incapable of). While monied, his fortune is the result of work, not lineage, and he seems to be loyal to a fault.<br /><br />On behalf of all the Mr. Bingleys of the world: What&#8217;s wrong with that?</div>

I know earlier in the year I promised I&#8217;d put up the Bible Studies I was taking with Jeff for CU, but these never really eventuated. Sorry!<br /><br />This semester hopefully will be different :)<br /><br /><br />Jeff Reddan & myself are conducting Bible Studies on Paul&#8217;s first letter to Timothy, on Tuesday afternoons. We&#8217;ve got roughly 5 people or so that have said they can come (although we&#8217;ve not yet had them all at once!), and it promises to be a really great time.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s the first study as led by Jeff:<br /><br /><a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/Wk1%20-%20False%20Teaching.pdf">Week 1: False Teaching [PDF]</a><br /><br />UPDATE: Jeff&#8217;s provided me with some more material for this study. <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/False%20Teaching%20notes.zip">[ZIP]</a></div>

The Scriptures are described as <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=23&amp;chapter=19&amp;verse=9&amp;end_verse=11&amp;version=31&amp;context=context">honey</a>, a <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=65&amp;chapter=5&amp;verse=11&amp;end_verse=13&amp;version=31&amp;context=context">few</a> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=67&amp;chapter=2&amp;verse=1&amp;end_verse=3&amp;version=31&amp;context=context">times</a> as milk, and as <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=53&amp;chapter=3&amp;verse=1&amp;end_verse=3&amp;version=31&amp;context=context">solid food</a> — like a baby&#8217;s diet and digestive system change and expand as he/she gets older, so our spiritual diet should grow, change, become deeper as we learn more about God &amp; His character.</div><div><br /></div><div>Food is a powerful metaphor; we know we need nutrients for our bodies to survive and thrive. If we don&#8217;t eat, we get hungry. If we try to eat too much in one go, we can struggle to digest it properly.</div><div><br /></div><div>These ideas extend, I think, to the way we treat Scripture, and spiritual nourishment in general. Are we getting enough? Are we benefiting from what we do get? These are both traps we can fall into.</div><div><br /></div><div>I like Christian author Steve Farrar&#8217;s description of these pitfalls: in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002361L16?ie=UTF8&tag=moremusi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002361L16">Point Man</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=moremusi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002361L16" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> he calls them &#8220;Spiritual Anorexia&#8221; and &#8220;Spiritual Bulimia.&#8221; Spiritual Anorexia describes those of us who simply don&#8217;t get enough Bible nourishment — we know it&#8217;s good for us, we know the benefit that it brings, and yet we simply don&#8217;t get it into us. It can be laziness, excuses (&#8220;I&#8217;m too busy / I don&#8217;t have time&#8221;), or straight-out pride (&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to&#8221;). All of us at some stage struggle with this spiritual eating disorder.</div><div><br /></div><div>Spiritual Bulimia, on the other hand, is different: we &#8220;gorge&#8221; on great teaching, Bible reading, fellowship. We listen, we taste, and we say &#8220;wow, that was great teaching!&#8221; — and then we effectively go and throw it up by not letting it affect us and change the way we live. We like the taste of spiritual nourishment, but we don&#8217;t want it to make us grow.</div><div><br />Following on from <a href="http://andrewdotnich.blogspot.com/2009/05/spiritual-learning-part-1-headheart.html">my first post</a> on this topic, which is more of a problem for you? I struggle with both: in my day-to-day life I believe I can get by without daily Bible reading (the spiritual equivalent of skipping meals). At the same time, however, whenever I&#8217;m blessed with amazing teaching (like a great sermon, an amazing camp, or a helpful book or podcast) my tendency is to say &#8220;wow, that was really tasty!&#8221; – and then throw it up as if it is of no use to me. Both of these are unhealthy habits, so I need to be constantly working on my spiritual diet.<br /></div><div><br /><hr /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thehappyrobot/898376137/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Creative Commons: thehappyrobot on flickr</span></a><br /></div></div>

Both are dangers in my life, but anorexia would be my main problem. Not eating at all has a similar effect to throwing everything up - you go hungry. So when I do eat it keeps me going for a while, but not eating again and I&#39;m back to an emaciated skeleton (spiritually speaking).</div>

My problem is often trying to &#39;do&#39; too much for God without being properly fed by Him. Nourishing my relationship with God, my character, and my personal relationships, requires a lot of patience.<br /><br />In practice, for me, that often looks like: a lot of reading and a lack of prayer, a lot of study and a lack of meditation on the Word&#8230; a tendency to drift towards mental exercise and away from heart-to-heart communion with God.<br /><br />I got rebuked hard by God this week for this tendency of mine! I love God, he&#39;s so precious&#8230; I can&#39;t believe I push him aside so often. I over-complicate things so I can pride myself in my mental prowess, but the gospel is so beautiful because it&#39;s so simple - the gospel is the love of God; Jesus died for my sin, and now I get to live with him!<br /><br />Yeah, spiritual bulimia would probably be my danger. I eat lots, but digest occasionally.</div>

So today is that day, the one that distinguishes itself every year for not being an unbirthday. They seem to come around more frequently as time progresses.<br /><br />What have I learned in the past 12 months?<br /><br /><h3>I Love People (but not enough!)</h3><br />The past 12 months have brought so many amazing people into my life in such ways that I couldn&#8217;t, wouldn&#8217;t have believed had they not happened. 2 countries, 4 cities, 3 churches, 2 universities, countless individuals – it really blows my mind how many awesome people I didn&#8217;t know just 12 months ago (well, 18 for some, but I hardly knew you guys then). I&#8217;m coming to realise that I love interacting with people more than almost anything in the world. What makes you special? What makes you tick? What are your gifts, talents, abilities? I want to know!<br /><br /><h3>I Love God (but not enough!)</h3><br />There have been times in the last 12 months when I have doubted my faith, when I have questioned whether the God I believe in is capable and trustworthy. Can He do what He promises? <br /><br />There have been so many reminders (including one just last week at Summit – thanks Pete Leslie!) that the answer is a resounding, overwhelming YES! All through the Bible there are reminders for weak people like me who have asked this question all through history.

I&#8217;ve nearly finished my uni degree, and I&#8217;m not hanging around for honours, so the question of what to <strong>do</strong> will be on the agenda.

But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. Only let us hold true to what we have attained.<br /><cite>Philippians 3:12-16, ESV</cite><br /></blockquote><br /><br />Press with me, won&#8217;t you?<br /><br /><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UCbcknyDfrs&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UCbcknyDfrs&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object></div>

<div>It&#8217;s been some time since we delved into the priceless treasures contained in W. McGonagall&#8217;s poetry. Today our protagonist has been banned from performing in the Royal Circus in Dundee, and he is most unimpressed. He is so put out at being treated in such an unfair manner that he&#8217;s had enough, and is going somewhere he&#8217;ll be appreciated. Hrumph.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /><hr /><br /><h2>Lines in Protest to the Dundee Magistrates</h2><br /><blockquote><br />Fellow citizens of Bonnie Dundee<br/><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px; height: 263px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_apqCDz1JZos/SlcqhLzCGjI/AAAAAAAAAAs/BOmDg_A0zIs/s400/angry_judge.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5356797031371381298" />Are ye aware how the magistrates have treated me?<br />Nay, do not stare or make a fuss<br />When I tell ye they have boycotted me from appearing in Royal Circus,<br />Which in my opinion is a great shame,<br />And a dishonour to the city&#8217;s name.<br /><br />Fellow citizens, I consider such treatment to be very hard;<br />&#8216;Tis proof for me they have little regard;<br />Or else in the circumstances they would have seen to my protection;<br />Then that would have been a proof of their affection,<br />And how Genius ought to be rewarded,<br />But instead my Genius has been disregarded<br />Why should the magistrates try and punish me in such a cruel form?<br />I never heard the like since I was born.<br />Fellow citizens, they have taken from me a part of my living<br />And as Christians they should have been giving;<br />But instead of that they have prevented Baron Ziegler from engaging me,<br />Which certainly is a disgrace to Bonnie Dundee.<br /><br />Who was&#8217;t that immortalised the old and the new railway bridges of the Silvery Tay?<br />Also the inauguration of the Hill of Balgay?<br />Likewise the Silvery Tay rolling on its way?<br />And the Newport Railway?<br />Besides the Dundee Volunteers?<br />Which met with their approbation and hearty cheers.<br />And has it come to this in Bonnie Dundee?<br />But, fellow-citizens, I will not submit to such an indignity<br />For I am resolved to leave the city<br />And bid the city a long farewell,<br />For I cannot get protection in it to dwell,<br />Therefore I&#8217;m resolved from it to flee<br />For a prophet has no honour in his own country,<br />And try to live in some other town<br />Where the magistrates won&#8217;t boycott me or try to keep me down<br /><br />No more shall the roughs of Bonnie Dundee<br />Get the chance of insulting or throwing missiles at me<br />For I&#8217;m going off to the beautiful west<br />To the fair city of Glasgow that I like the best,<br />Where the River Clyde rolls on to the sea,<br />And the lark and the blackbird whistles with glee.<br />And your beautiful bridges across the River Clyde,<br />And on your bonnie banks I&#8217;m going to reside.<br /></blockquote></div></div>

Good thoughts.<br /><br />I tend to the first extreme as well. In recent times I&#39;ve been blessed to be part of a church and a Bible study group which seems to strike up a good balance of both; being part of that helps me combat it.<br /><br />Also, my wife probably tends to the other extreme, and so, as with so many other things, we balance each other out, in a mutually beneficial way.</div>

Good thoughts&#8230;<br /><br />Well, to be Spirit-driven means to go to the Word. I would give the second response. The first response is poor because it&#39;s telling someone to try harder at something (which apparently they&#39;re a failure at) which they don&#39;t necessarily understand. The second response is pastoral, because it is kind and points someone in the real way to know God better; but not because its meaning in contrary to being &#39;Spirit-driven&#39;.<br /><br />I think I totally understand the danger you&#39;re picking up on&#8230; the worst kind of Christian is the one who thinks they are spiritually superior to others, who looks down others whom they label as &#39;unspiritual&#39; - over-spiritualising pharisees who&#39;s ideas about learning and living life have faint echoes of gnosticism in them.<br /><br />Just some clarifying thoughts (because I&#39;m confusing :p): what is &#39;unspiritual&#39; is the flesh, our sinful nature - that which is not born of the Spirit. The unspiritual man is the man who has not been born of the Spirit. But every Christian is &#39;spiritual&#39; because they have been born of the Spirit&#8230; but the &#39;unspiritual&#39;, the flesh, is still with us, because we are still growing. Now, the flesh prides on its own ability to understand things or make life work: sometimes by reliance on the strength of the mind, sometimes on the strength of the heart, and the battle we fight is to be humbled and broken, and allow God&#39;s strength to be made perfect where our weakness lies - whether we find our hearts are too weak, or our minds too weak. Only the Spirit can quicken our hearts or our minds to true understanding and genuine affections and actions; the flesh can&#39;t achieve that.</div>

Hi Jack &amp; Lorelei, thanks for contributing!<br /><br />Jack: Thanks for your thoughts. Perhaps the two scales can be married like this:<br /><br />A Spirit-driven growth in a Christian will lead to both proper knowledge of God&#39;s character and an appropriate response in the way we live and relate to Him and other people.<br /><br />But because we&#39;re sinful, fallen people, and our sanctification is a gradual process, we don&#39;t act like that. We will always err on one side or the other, and I guess that was the thrust behind my original post. <br /><br />Also, we must be very careful when labelling people as &quot;unspiritual&quot;. We can&#39;t see their hearts; a good look at our own will quickly show that we&#39;re not that amazing ourselves. <br /><br />I know that I want to be guided and enlightened by the Holy Spirit. At the same time, however, I acknowledge that my sinful nature pushes me towards an incomplete/lopsided understanding of who God is and how I should respond; that&#39;s &quot;unspiritual&quot;, as you call it.<br /><br />How would you advise a fellow believer who has a deep love for God but has trouble understanding the character of God as demonstrated in history? Would you say to them &quot;you&#39;re not being spiritual/Spirit-driven enough?&quot; Or would you say &quot;You love God; let&#39;s look at His Word and see what He tells us about Himself?&quot;</div>

Interesting subject. I look forward to reading more. <br />I think by nature I fall into the second category. When I became saved it was the actions and love of people around me that validated what they told me of John 3:16. I combat this tendency with some advice I got once from the principal of Bible College SA. He said that the relationship with God is like any relationship, in that, during the good and easy times we should invest time in understanding the other&#39;s character. Then in the hard times it is our knowledge of the other that will carry the relationship through, because we can choose to focus on what we know of him/her irrespective of what our feelings, emotions and experiences are. We can increase our knowledge of God&#39;s character by studying both the Old and New Testaments. Of course, some people with knowledge voluntarily give up their faith notwithstanding, so I am just talking about the value of scripture to those who commit to finishing the race. Personally I also find that knowledge of God&#39;s character as revealed in His actions through history gives confidence to take risks for God. If knowledge cannot be shaken by persecution, hardship, rejection, confusion, spiritual attack or any other experience, then if we have knowledge of God there is nothing we won&#39;t attempt for the Kingdom.</div>

Awesome. Spiritual learing is one massive topic! Hope to read more thinking from you on the topic.<br /><br /><br />Just some thoughts&#8230;<br /><br />I think what we usually mean by the &#39;head&#39; is our reason, and what we usually mean by the &#39;heart&#39; is our affections. Truth and treasure.<br /><br />We can&#39;t say we treasure Christ if we don&#39;t care to know more of him. We can&#39;t treasure what we haven&#39;t seen or known. Neither can we say we really know Christ if what we claim to have seen hasn&#39;t moved us to treasure him. To whatever degree we don&#39;t treasure him, we haven&#39;t seen nor understood him.<br /><br />I&#39;ve always been suspicious of the distinction made between &#39;head&#39; and &#39;heart&#39; in regards to the source of difficulty in spiritual growth/learning. I don&#39;t think striking a balance is the solution, necessarily. Regarding spiritual learning, rather than imagining two opposites ends of a scale, I think we need to somehow form a picture of the head and the heart being in harmony with each other through their connection to a deeper foundation reality - the spiritual. I&#39;m thinking of the new self (which includes renewed heart *and* mind) and the indwelling Spirit.<br /><br />1 CORINTHIANS 2:6-16 is the passage to meditate on.<br /><br />The real battle isn&#39;t between the head and the heart, but between the spiritual and the unspiritual. Our struggle is between dependence on the power of God and dependence on the power of self (our mind OR heart can be sources of self-dependence) for our learning.<br /><br />I think it&#39;s so so very possible to learn the Scriptures unspiritually (without the Spirit&#39;s illumination) - you know this when your head knowledge doesn&#39;t move you or change the way you live.<br /><br />Equally, I think those who don&#39;t care much for theology but think that only feeling and doing are important, are living the Christian life without the Spirit - because all the Spirit ever wants to do is glorify Christ and make him known, especially through the way we live and relate! If that&#39;s not the purpose of our living - which necessarily must be informed by a mental and spiritual grasping of reality - then it is unspiritual.</div>
