Since posting about <a href="http://andrewdotnich.blogspot.com/2011/08/redeeming-some-time.html">feeling endlessly distracted</a> by machines, technology and up-to-the-nanosecond information, it seems I'm not alone. <a href="http://twitter.com/colvinius">Mark Colvin</a> (one of my favourite Australian journalists) broadcast a great interview with William Powers, author of the book <em>Hamlet's Blackberry</em>.<br /><br />It's a fascinating interview, and sounds like a really good read.<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3309008.htm">Read/listen to the story</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061687170/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=moremusi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0061687170">Check out the book</a>.<img alt="" border="0" height="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0061687170&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" style="display:none !important; border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="0" /></li></ul></div>

<blockquote>"Blinded by distractions,<br />lost in matter-less affairs…"<br />&mdash; dc Talk, "Day By Day"<br /></blockquote><br />Recently while sitting on a train, a largely unremarkable thing happened &ndash; so unremarkable it gave me pause for thought. What was this non-event? <br /><br />I got a new PB in Bejeweled Blitz. Not just any Personal Best: I cracked the half-million mark (and beat my previous best by over 150,000)! I enjoyed the quick squirt of adrenaline as it shot through my body, and then I thought: "Huh."<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sNOrDQVPYy4/TkKSmBRrWAI/AAAAAAAAADc/vNWa-NNRMN0/s1600/1png.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img border="0" height="400" width="267" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sNOrDQVPYy4/TkKSmBRrWAI/AAAAAAAAADc/vNWa-NNRMN0/s400/1png.png" /></a></div><br />For a while now I've become increasingly frustrated and annoyed at the way the Internet and smart phones have trained my attention patterns &mdash; the classic Gen-Y dance I call "The Context-Switch One-Step". Take your electronic distraction generator in one hand, drop your head slightly, place earphones in ears, and away we go, with a one-two-three, one-two-three, facebook-check, twitter-feeds, email-check, one-more-game, when's-that-tram, one-two-three&hellip;<br /><br />&hellip;sorry.<br /><br />Such constant "engagement" (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinner_boxes">pellet-popping</a> to <a href="http://drinking-from-the-firehose.urbanup.com/1867465">drinking from the firehose</a>) has made it very hard for my brain to either 1) switch off or 2) give undivided attention to just one thing. Sometimes this is a benefit, but mostly, it just leaves me distracted and not at rest.<br /><br />This spills out into all sorts of areas; why bother taking the time to cook a healthy meal when "fast food" slips into the cycle more easily? Or <a href="http://www.harmonicalessons.com/">learning a new skill</a>? Or making any time investment at all?<br /><br />But the place where rubber hits road for me the hardest is spending time with God &mdash; how can <a href="http://andrewdotnich.blogspot.com/2011/04/voice-part-1.html">I</a> <a href="http://andrewdotnich.blogspot.com/2011/04/voice-part-2.html">be</a> <a href="http://andrewdotnich.blogspot.com/2011/06/voice-part-3.html">still</a> when everything in my mind screams "hurry, hurry, faster, more!" How can I spend time meditating on a chunk of connected verses, when they seem to meld into a stream of 140-character morsels right before my eyes?<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World">Aldous Huxley would be horrified&hellip;</a></div>

Arthur: I love that picture - every time I come across it it hits home with new force, and it&#39;s a both/and scenario here in the West!</div>

Or maybe Huxley would just <a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/images/Amusing-Ourselves-To-Death.jpg" rel="nofollow">smile knowingly</a>...<br /><br />I love your description of the one-step!</div>

Oh wow, this totally hit home with me. I can so relate! Being a Gen-Y tech/facebook junky frustrates me no end. The days of concentrating seem to have disappeared....but I&#39;m determined to rediscover them somehow.</div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_apqCDz1JZos/SeBMCfWf_yI/AAAAAAAAAAU/N5-rFQPDCdI/s1600-h/no-caffeine.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_apqCDz1JZos/SeBMCfWf_yI/AAAAAAAAAAU/N5-rFQPDCdI/s200/no-caffeine.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5323338365211246370" border="0" /></a><br />Anyone who knows me knows I love my coffee – plunger, espresso, flat white, short macchiato, I'm there. Unfortunately, my love for caffeinated goodness often means my consumption goes up in direct proportion to my busyness levels, until I find myself drinking too much of the stuff.<br /><br />Not being the sort of person that's really capable of doing anything by halves (including coffee drinking), I combat this by going on caffeine fasts, where I'll not drink anything caffeinated for a period of time (usually a week). As I sit here with a nearly-empty thermos of plunger coffee, I can't help but think that it's time for another one.<br /><br />So as of midnight tonight, I'll be completely off caffeine (in any form: tea, coffee, chocolate, energy drinks, whatever) for the entire week. Usually by day 3, my body goes into full-scale rebellion, and tries to make life miserable. Thankfully there aren't any uni classes this week.<br /><br />Wish me luck…<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarandweedkiller/1118758309/"><span style="font-size:78%;"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Photo Creative Commons: </span></span></a><span class="nickname"><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarandweedkiller/1118758309/"><span style="font-size:78%;">GIRLintheCAFE on Flickr</span></a><br /></span></div>

I too am dancing at the door of caffeine's hold. Not one week passes by without a cup of Earl Grey. It's going to take me some time to finish the best price-per-unit purchase of a box of 100 tea bags.<BR/><BR/>Good luck.</div>
