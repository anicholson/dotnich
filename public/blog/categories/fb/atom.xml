"Are we so different?"<br />younger brother calls to elder.<br />"We both know the old dodderer<br />means well, but you've got to<br />admit He's a bit misguided.<br />We've got brains, we've got time -<br />let's go, see what <i>we</i> can do!"<br /><br />"Are you kidding?!"<br />rejoined the elder.<br />"We have a real base here! It's true<br />the Old Man is a bit tiresome, but <br />this farm's a solid investment!<br />Soon He'll die, and we can run things<br />the way they <i>should</i> be done! Or at least<br />not pretend so much&hellip;"<br /><br />So the younger ran out one way<br />and threw away his lot, while<br />the other toiled and strained and<br />worked long years on <br />his share of the plot.<br /><br />And all the while the Father grieved<br />for the day His two lost sons would<br />come back to His heart, and Home.</div>

"Don't worry, Dad, I'm a big kid now!" exclaimed the lad, straining under the weight of a big box of this-and-that. His Father smiled knowingly to Himself. The more he changed, the more he seemed to stay the same. "But he is growing," He said to himself. "And becoming more like his Brother every day."<br />And then there was a crash and a cry from down the hall, and the Father rushed to clean up the newly-created mess of boy and <i>bric-à-brac</i>.</div>

No, not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQT0t2s1MoE">the song</a>!<br /><br />I went for a bike ride on Friday night; no reason, I just felt like upping and heading onto the road. I turned off Wellington Parade into Yarra Park, cruising past the MCG when a bridge caught my eye. The bridge takes its pedestrian passengers over the Jolimont railway lines and across into Birrarung Marr. I imagine that it's a well-known route, but I'd never been over it, so I rode towards it and decided to stop at the top to enjoy the view.<br /><br />While I was sitting there on a bench, I was treated to an amazing aural experience. There are speakers embedded in the walls of the bridge, and they were playing an intoxicating mix of folk music from all different cultures. I sat entranced at the sensory spectacle; the beautiful city lights of Melbourne in front of me, the glow of the 'G behind me, the yellow lights on the bridge giving an other-worldly light to my surroundings, and the music of different cultures blending in sweet cacophony over the rumble of the trains passing underneath. <br /><br />It occurred to me that this was a little taste of what Heaven will be like - the music, rhythm, language and expression of every tribe, nation, culture, all gathered together in joyous expression of praise to God. And while I can't wait for that day to come (and come quick, Lord Jesus!) I'm really grateful for little sneak peaks like this :)</div>
