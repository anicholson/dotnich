New year, new poem! Wrote this after coming back from a trip to the Middle East. Spent some time with people I barely knew (but now consider good friends) tooling around sightseeing and attempting to be make the world a better place. We did do some openly Christian stuff, but some of the images that stuck the most closely to me are from time we spent in a Palestinian refugee camp in Bourj Al-Barajneh, Beirut. There's a great NGO called the <a href="http://inmafoundation.org">Inma Foundation</a> we were able to volunteer with; painting, cleaning, and decorating their centre within the camp. Check them out. I could try and spend words and words and words explaining the plight of these refugees â€“ but maybe you need to go educate yourself as well :). Too many words, not enough poetry!<br /><hr/><br /><blockquote><br />I saw a truck driving through Bourj Al-Barajneh Camp<br />  It carried a load of rubble<br />  And a set of keys to a dream<br />  that will never be realised.<br />  <br />I saw a man walking through Bourj Al-Barajneh Camp<br />  His body wasn't staying still<br />  But his soul was firmly stuck <br />  in that box of concrete, wires and despair. <br />  <br />I saw children playing in Bourj Al-Barajneh Camp<br />  They weren't running, excited,<br />  Full of joy and light because<br />  They didn't know they were allowed.<br />  <br />I saw a Son of Man in Bourj Al-Barajneh Camp<br />  He said He had plans for His children,<br />  For a hope and for a future.<br />  I'm glad Somebody does at least.<br /></blockquote></div>
