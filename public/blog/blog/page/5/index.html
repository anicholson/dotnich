<div>It&#8217;s been some time since we delved into the priceless treasures contained in W. McGonagall&#8217;s poetry. Today our protagonist has been banned from performing in the Royal Circus in Dundee, and he is most unimpressed. He is so put out at being treated in such an unfair manner that he&#8217;s had enough, and is going somewhere he&#8217;ll be appreciated. Hrumph.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /><hr /><br /><h2>Lines in Protest to the Dundee Magistrates</h2><br /><blockquote><br />Fellow citizens of Bonnie Dundee<br/><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px; height: 263px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_apqCDz1JZos/SlcqhLzCGjI/AAAAAAAAAAs/BOmDg_A0zIs/s400/angry_judge.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5356797031371381298" />Are ye aware how the magistrates have treated me?<br />Nay, do not stare or make a fuss<br />When I tell ye they have boycotted me from appearing in Royal Circus,<br />Which in my opinion is a great shame,<br />And a dishonour to the city&#8217;s name.<br /><br />Fellow citizens, I consider such treatment to be very hard;<br />&#8216;Tis proof for me they have little regard;<br />Or else in the circumstances they would have seen to my protection;<br />Then that would have been a proof of their affection,<br />And how Genius ought to be rewarded,<br />But instead my Genius has been disregarded<br />Why should the magistrates try and punish me in such a cruel form?<br />I never heard the like since I was born.<br />Fellow citizens, they have taken from me a part of my living<br />And as Christians they should have been giving;<br />But instead of that they have prevented Baron Ziegler from engaging me,<br />Which certainly is a disgrace to Bonnie Dundee.<br /><br />Who was&#8217;t that immortalised the old and the new railway bridges of the Silvery Tay?<br />Also the inauguration of the Hill of Balgay?<br />Likewise the Silvery Tay rolling on its way?<br />And the Newport Railway?<br />Besides the Dundee Volunteers?<br />Which met with their approbation and hearty cheers.<br />And has it come to this in Bonnie Dundee?<br />But, fellow-citizens, I will not submit to such an indignity<br />For I am resolved to leave the city<br />And bid the city a long farewell,<br />For I cannot get protection in it to dwell,<br />Therefore I&#8217;m resolved from it to flee<br />For a prophet has no honour in his own country,<br />And try to live in some other town<br />Where the magistrates won&#8217;t boycott me or try to keep me down<br /><br />No more shall the roughs of Bonnie Dundee<br />Get the chance of insulting or throwing missiles at me<br />For I&#8217;m going off to the beautiful west<br />To the fair city of Glasgow that I like the best,<br />Where the River Clyde rolls on to the sea,<br />And the lark and the blackbird whistles with glee.<br />And your beautiful bridges across the River Clyde,<br />And on your bonnie banks I&#8217;m going to reside.<br /></blockquote></div></div>

Good thoughts.<br /><br />I tend to the first extreme as well. In recent times I&#39;ve been blessed to be part of a church and a Bible study group which seems to strike up a good balance of both; being part of that helps me combat it.<br /><br />Also, my wife probably tends to the other extreme, and so, as with so many other things, we balance each other out, in a mutually beneficial way.</div>

Good thoughts&#8230;<br /><br />Well, to be Spirit-driven means to go to the Word. I would give the second response. The first response is poor because it&#39;s telling someone to try harder at something (which apparently they&#39;re a failure at) which they don&#39;t necessarily understand. The second response is pastoral, because it is kind and points someone in the real way to know God better; but not because its meaning in contrary to being &#39;Spirit-driven&#39;.<br /><br />I think I totally understand the danger you&#39;re picking up on&#8230; the worst kind of Christian is the one who thinks they are spiritually superior to others, who looks down others whom they label as &#39;unspiritual&#39; - over-spiritualising pharisees who&#39;s ideas about learning and living life have faint echoes of gnosticism in them.<br /><br />Just some clarifying thoughts (because I&#39;m confusing :p): what is &#39;unspiritual&#39; is the flesh, our sinful nature - that which is not born of the Spirit. The unspiritual man is the man who has not been born of the Spirit. But every Christian is &#39;spiritual&#39; because they have been born of the Spirit&#8230; but the &#39;unspiritual&#39;, the flesh, is still with us, because we are still growing. Now, the flesh prides on its own ability to understand things or make life work: sometimes by reliance on the strength of the mind, sometimes on the strength of the heart, and the battle we fight is to be humbled and broken, and allow God&#39;s strength to be made perfect where our weakness lies - whether we find our hearts are too weak, or our minds too weak. Only the Spirit can quicken our hearts or our minds to true understanding and genuine affections and actions; the flesh can&#39;t achieve that.</div>

Hi Jack &amp; Lorelei, thanks for contributing!<br /><br />Jack: Thanks for your thoughts. Perhaps the two scales can be married like this:<br /><br />A Spirit-driven growth in a Christian will lead to both proper knowledge of God&#39;s character and an appropriate response in the way we live and relate to Him and other people.<br /><br />But because we&#39;re sinful, fallen people, and our sanctification is a gradual process, we don&#39;t act like that. We will always err on one side or the other, and I guess that was the thrust behind my original post. <br /><br />Also, we must be very careful when labelling people as &quot;unspiritual&quot;. We can&#39;t see their hearts; a good look at our own will quickly show that we&#39;re not that amazing ourselves. <br /><br />I know that I want to be guided and enlightened by the Holy Spirit. At the same time, however, I acknowledge that my sinful nature pushes me towards an incomplete/lopsided understanding of who God is and how I should respond; that&#39;s &quot;unspiritual&quot;, as you call it.<br /><br />How would you advise a fellow believer who has a deep love for God but has trouble understanding the character of God as demonstrated in history? Would you say to them &quot;you&#39;re not being spiritual/Spirit-driven enough?&quot; Or would you say &quot;You love God; let&#39;s look at His Word and see what He tells us about Himself?&quot;</div>

Interesting subject. I look forward to reading more. <br />I think by nature I fall into the second category. When I became saved it was the actions and love of people around me that validated what they told me of John 3:16. I combat this tendency with some advice I got once from the principal of Bible College SA. He said that the relationship with God is like any relationship, in that, during the good and easy times we should invest time in understanding the other&#39;s character. Then in the hard times it is our knowledge of the other that will carry the relationship through, because we can choose to focus on what we know of him/her irrespective of what our feelings, emotions and experiences are. We can increase our knowledge of God&#39;s character by studying both the Old and New Testaments. Of course, some people with knowledge voluntarily give up their faith notwithstanding, so I am just talking about the value of scripture to those who commit to finishing the race. Personally I also find that knowledge of God&#39;s character as revealed in His actions through history gives confidence to take risks for God. If knowledge cannot be shaken by persecution, hardship, rejection, confusion, spiritual attack or any other experience, then if we have knowledge of God there is nothing we won&#39;t attempt for the Kingdom.</div>

Awesome. Spiritual learing is one massive topic! Hope to read more thinking from you on the topic.<br /><br /><br />Just some thoughts&#8230;<br /><br />I think what we usually mean by the &#39;head&#39; is our reason, and what we usually mean by the &#39;heart&#39; is our affections. Truth and treasure.<br /><br />We can&#39;t say we treasure Christ if we don&#39;t care to know more of him. We can&#39;t treasure what we haven&#39;t seen or known. Neither can we say we really know Christ if what we claim to have seen hasn&#39;t moved us to treasure him. To whatever degree we don&#39;t treasure him, we haven&#39;t seen nor understood him.<br /><br />I&#39;ve always been suspicious of the distinction made between &#39;head&#39; and &#39;heart&#39; in regards to the source of difficulty in spiritual growth/learning. I don&#39;t think striking a balance is the solution, necessarily. Regarding spiritual learning, rather than imagining two opposites ends of a scale, I think we need to somehow form a picture of the head and the heart being in harmony with each other through their connection to a deeper foundation reality - the spiritual. I&#39;m thinking of the new self (which includes renewed heart *and* mind) and the indwelling Spirit.<br /><br />1 CORINTHIANS 2:6-16 is the passage to meditate on.<br /><br />The real battle isn&#39;t between the head and the heart, but between the spiritual and the unspiritual. Our struggle is between dependence on the power of God and dependence on the power of self (our mind OR heart can be sources of self-dependence) for our learning.<br /><br />I think it&#39;s so so very possible to learn the Scriptures unspiritually (without the Spirit&#39;s illumination) - you know this when your head knowledge doesn&#39;t move you or change the way you live.<br /><br />Equally, I think those who don&#39;t care much for theology but think that only feeling and doing are important, are living the Christian life without the Spirit - because all the Spirit ever wants to do is glorify Christ and make him known, especially through the way we live and relate! If that&#39;s not the purpose of our living - which necessarily must be informed by a mental and spiritual grasping of reality - then it is unspiritual.</div>

			AoM Better Man Challenge: Day 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class='post'>
The first activity in Art of Manliness&#8217; <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/29/announcing-the-30-days-to-a-better-man-project/">Better Man Challenge</a> is to outline one&#8217;s <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/31/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-1-define-your-core-values/">5 Core Values</a>: the principles/things that you hold as valuable above all others. But it&#8217;s not enough to simply state them, one must clearly define them as well. So here we go, in order:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Faith</strong><br />Over and above anything else, the thing that defines who I am is my faith. I&#8217;m a deeply committed Christian; I aim to know what I believe and why I believe it. If it weren&#8217;t for the saving death and resurrection of my Lord Jesus Christ, I would have no strength for today, no hope for the future, and no security and purpose in who I am and what I&#8217;m here for.<br /><br /><strong>Family/friends</strong><br />Anyone who knows me, knows that I&#8217;m a people person. I love spending time with others: interacting, learning, growing together. I love my family, with all our quirks <em>[quirks, Andrew? Surely not!]</em> – I see little pieces of all of them in my character and makeup, and I wouldn&#8217;t change that for anything.<br /><br />Same goes for my friends – my closest friends are like family to me: brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts. Particularly my brothers in arms: strong Christian guys who fight the same battles, decry the same lies, share the same dreams. I love you guys.<br /><br /><strong>Wisdom</strong><br />The Bible <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:7;&amp;version=50;">says</a>, &#8220;Wisdom is the principle thing; therefore, get wisdom.&#8221;<br /><br />I like Princeton WordNet&#8217;s <a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;s=wisdom&amp;i=1&amp;h=00000#c">definition of wisdom</a>: &#8220;the trait of utilizing knowledge and experience with common sense and insight.&#8221;<br /><br />Knowledge (see below) and experience aren&#8217;t much use if you don&#8217;t deliberately try and learn and grow from them. One can be extremely intelligent, or extremely successful, and still be a complete fool. One can also be poorly educated, have never been anywhere much, and still be incredibly wise.<br /><br />I want to be known as someone &#8220;who understood the times and knew what [to] do.&#8221; (another <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%2012:32;&amp;version=31;">Bible reference</a>)<br /><br /><br /><strong>Knowledge</strong><br />I&#8217;m an inquisitive person by nature; a true generalist (sometimes to a fault), I find most things fascinating, and strive to constantly learn new things. Sometimes this means that I&#8217;m not as focused as I should be, but I&#8217;d rather be &#8220;jack of all trades&#8221; (and &#8220;master of none&#8221;) than someone who knows everything about very little.<br /><br /><strong>Adventure</strong><br />Finally, I believe life is an adventure waiting to be lived. There is interest to be found even in the seemingly inane, and fascination in the humdrum; the trick is to look for it.<br /><br /><div><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_apqCDz1JZos/SiUJIXG6W_I/AAAAAAAAAAc/7-5_8fO3QyI/s1600-h/xkcd308modified.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 280px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_apqCDz1JZos/SiUJIXG6W_I/AAAAAAAAAAc/7-5_8fO3QyI/s320/xkcd308modified.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5342686572191570930" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:85%;"><br /><a href="http://xkcd.com/308/">Creative Commons: XKCD #308 (modified for language)</a></span><br /></div></div>

Very apt summary of your values - I think I notice all these things in you every time we&#39;re in conversation!<br /><br />Perhaps the subtler one is &#39;adventure&#39;, but I guess you&#39;re a bit like me in that regard: to satisfy the thirst, the adventure doesn&#39;t need to be merely physical. Even so, I think we prefer safety too much. Dammit, you&#39;ve awakened my thirst! Let&#39;s adventure more.</div>

It doesn&#8217;t seem to be a particularly important battle on the world stage (particularly for the residents of Dundee, or indeed anywhere), but thanks to his efforts, we can learn about it in a form other than prose&#8230;<br /><br /><hr /><br /><h2>The Battle Of El-Teb</h2><br /><blockquote><br /><br />Ye sons of Great Britain, I think no shame<br />To write in praise of brave General Graham!<br />Whose name will be handed down to posterity without any stigma,<br />Because, at the battle of El-Teb, he defeated Osman Digna.<br /><br />With an army about five thousand strong,<br />To El-Teb, in the year 1884, he marched along,<br />And bivouacked there for the night;<br />While around their fires they only thought of the coming fight.<br /><br />They kept up their fires all the long night,<br />Which made the encampment appear weird-like to the sight;<br />While the men were completely soaked with the rain,<br />But the brave heroes disdained to complain.<br /><br />The brave heroes were glad when daylight did appear,<br />And when the reveille was sounded, they gave a hearty cheer<br />And their fires were piled up higher again,<br />Then they tried to dry their clothes that were soaked with the rain.<br /><br />Then breakfast was taken about eight o&#8217;clock,<br />And when over, each man stood in the ranks as firm as a rock,<br />And every man seemed to be on his guard &#8211;<br />All silent and ready to move forward.<br /><br />The first movement was a short one from where they lay &#8211;<br />Then they began to advance towards El-Teb without dismay,<br />And showed that all was in order for the fray,<br />While every man&#8217;s heart seemed to feel light and gay.<br /><br />The enemy&#8217;s position could be seen in the distance far away<br />But the brave heroes marched on without delay &#8211;<br />Whilst the enemy&#8217;s banners floated in the air,<br />And dark swarms of men were scattered near by there.<br /><br />Their force was a large one &#8211; its front extended over a mile,<br />And all along the line their guns were all in file;<br />But as the British advanced, they disappeared,<br />While our brave kilty lads loudly cheered.<br /><br />Thus slowly and cautiously brave General Graham proceeded<br />And to save his men from slaughter, great caution was needed,<br />Because Osman Digna&#8217;s force was about ten thousand strong;<br />But he said, Come on, my brave lads, we&#8217;ll conquer them ere long!<br /><br />It was about ten o&#8217;clock when they came near the enemy&#8217;s lines,<br />And on the morning air could be heard the cheerful chimes<br />Corning from the pipes of the gallant Black Watch,<br />Which every ear in the British force was eager to catch.<br /><br />Then they passed by the enemy about mid-day,<br />While every Arab seemed to have his gun ready for the fray<br />When a bullet strikes down General Baker by the way,<br />But he is soon in the saddle again without delay,<br /><br />And ready for any service that he could perform;<br />Whilst the bullets fell around them in a perfect storm<br />That they had to lie down, but not through fear,<br />Because the enemy was about 800 yards on their left rear.<br /><br />Then General Graham addressed his men,<br />And said, If they won&#8217;t attack us, we must attack them,<br />So start to your feet, my lads, and never fear,<br />And strike up your bagpipes, and give a loud cheer.<br /><br />So they leapt to their feet, and gave a loud cheer,<br />While the Arabs swept down upon them without the least fear,<br />And put aside their rifles, and grasped their spears;<br />Whilst the British bullets in front of them the earth uptears.<br /><br />Then the British charged them with their cold steel,<br />Which made the Arabs backward for to reel;<br />But they dashed forward again on their ranks without dismay,<br />But before the terrible fire of their musketry they were swept away.<br /><br />Oh, God of Heaven! it was a terrible sight<br />To see, and hear the Arabs shouting with all their might<br />A fearful oath when they got an inch of cold steel,<br />Which forced them backwards again and made them reel.<br /><br />By two o&#8217;clock they were fairly beat,<br />And Osman Digna, the false prophet, was forced to retreat<br />After three hours of an incessant fight;<br />But Heaven, &#8216;tis said, defends the right.<br /><br />And I think he ought to be ashamed of himself;<br />For I consider he has acted the part of a silly elf,<br />By thinking to conquer the armies of the Lord<br />With his foolish and benighted rebel horde.<br /></blockquote></div>

Political correctness aside, this relic is a  jewel in the glorious art of story-tell. Bivouack in peace, McGonagall; what&#8217;s a fatwa to a dead poet&#8230;</div>

Beautiful Summer now hath fled,<br />And the face of Nature doth seem dead,<br />And the leaves are withered, and falling off the trees,<br />By the nipping and chilling autumnal breeze.<br /><br />The pleasures of the little birds are all fled,<br />And with the cold many of them will be found dead,<br />Because the leaves of the trees are scattered in the blast,<br />And makes the feathered creatures feel downcast.<br /><br />Because there are no leaves on the trees to shield them from the storm<br />On a windy, and rainy, cloudy morn;<br />Which makes their little hearts throb with pain,<br />By the chilling blast and the pitiless rain.<br /><br />But still they are more contented than the children of God,<br />As long as they can pick up a worm from the sod,<br />Or anything they can get to eat,<br />Just, for instance, a stale crust of bread or a grain of wheat.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the little birds in the time of the snow,<br />Also of the little street waifs, that are driven to and fro,<br />And trembling in the cold blast, and chilled to the bone,<br />For the want of food and clothing, and a warm home.<br /><br />Besides think of the sorrows of the wandering poor,<br />That are wandering in the cold blast from door to door;<br />And begging, for Heaven&#8217;s sake, a crust of bread,<br />And alas! Not knowing where to lay their head.<br /><br />While the rich are well fed and covered from the cold,<br />While the poor are starving, both young and old;<br />Alas! It is the case in this boasted Christian land,<br />Where as the rich are told to be kind to the poor, is God&#8217;s command.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the working man when he&#8217;s no work to do,<br />Who&#8217;s got a wife and family, perhaps four or two,<br />And the father searching for work, and no work can be had,<br />The thought, I&#8217;m sure, &#8216;tis enough to drive the poor man mad.<br /><br />Because for his wife and family he must feel,<br />And perhaps the thought thereof will cause him to steal<br />Bread for his family, that are starving at home,<br />While the thought thereof makes him sigh heavily and groan.<br /><br />Alas! The pangs of hunger are very hard to hide,<br />And few people can their temper control,<br />Or become reconciled to their fate,<br />Especially when they cannot find anything to eat.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the struggles of the poor to make a living,<br />Because the rich unto them seldom are giving;<br />Wereas they are told he that giveth to the poor lendeth unto the Lord,<br />But alas! they rather incline their money to hoard.<br /><br />Then theres the little news-vendors in the street,<br />Running about perhaps with bare feet;<br />And if the rich chance to see such creatures in the street,<br />In general they make a sudden retreat.<br /></blockquote><br /><hr /><span style="font-size:85%;"><br />Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deniscollette/1582876153/">Denis Collette on Flickr</a>.</span></div>

Great advise Arthur.<br /><br />One blog I quite like is i.g.spong.com written by a mate (and former announcer) of mine. He also uses his blog for 1 minute radio spots, so he usually limits them to 140 words. It helps to keep them pithy.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve tried to restrain myself to a definite theme or topic and within that take a subject and relate it to something that&#8217;s happened recently (in the news or to me personally). This usually means ignoring large areas of personal interest (e.g. media and politics), but can still allow me to deal with the issues behind them.<br /><br />*Ramble Ends*<br /><br />(I&#8217;d be up for tag teaming).</div>

It took me a while to get going. If you are writing for a readership, it does have to be very regular. A few things seem to help:<br /><br />- Tag-teaming with someone<br /><br />- Building up a backlog of drafts and ideas (even if they don&#8217;t get published, it all goes into the mill)<br /><br />- Blogging around central topics/themes rather than random personal junk from my head<br /><br />- Stuff that other people are keen to hear about<br /><br />See http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/19/the-4-pillars-of-writing-exceptional-blogs/<br /><br />Arthur</div>

…resulted in some eclectic purchases – a dead white guy, some not-quite-dead white guys, some nowhere-near-dead white guys, and a nowhere-near-dead black guy:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://orders.koorong.com/search/details.jhtml?code=0140444491">Fear and Trembling</a> — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soren_Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a></li><li><a href="http://orders.koorong.com/search/details.jhtml?code=0851119751">The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God</a> – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Carson">D.

I do think that the Emergent movement takes a lot of ideas from his philosophy, so I&#8217;m interested in finding out more about it.<br /><br />I know Carson &amp; Sproul are solid, and I didn&#8217;t have these works of theirs already; I&#8217;m sure they will be edifying (Carson&#8217;s is, I think, a collation of talks and a fairly short work; Sproul&#8217;s one a bit longer).<br /><br />Musically, I&#8217;d enjoyed hearing the singles from the Falling Up album on radio, and decided to spring for the whole album. Enjoying what I hear so far.<br /><br />The most unusual (for me) item on the list is the last one; I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of hip-hop/rap, so this is something of a musical diversion. I figured if I was going to try out a new genre of music, I might as well choose an artist who fills his lyrics with Jesus.<br /><br />Already listened to both CDs, but the books will have to wait until end of semester.</div>
