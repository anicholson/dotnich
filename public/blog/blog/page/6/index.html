It doesn&#8217;t seem to be a particularly important battle on the world stage (particularly for the residents of Dundee, or indeed anywhere), but thanks to his efforts, we can learn about it in a form other than prose&#8230;<br /><br /><hr /><br /><h2>The Battle Of El-Teb</h2><br /><blockquote><br /><br />Ye sons of Great Britain, I think no shame<br />To write in praise of brave General Graham!<br />Whose name will be handed down to posterity without any stigma,<br />Because, at the battle of El-Teb, he defeated Osman Digna.<br /><br />With an army about five thousand strong,<br />To El-Teb, in the year 1884, he marched along,<br />And bivouacked there for the night;<br />While around their fires they only thought of the coming fight.<br /><br />They kept up their fires all the long night,<br />Which made the encampment appear weird-like to the sight;<br />While the men were completely soaked with the rain,<br />But the brave heroes disdained to complain.<br /><br />The brave heroes were glad when daylight did appear,<br />And when the reveille was sounded, they gave a hearty cheer<br />And their fires were piled up higher again,<br />Then they tried to dry their clothes that were soaked with the rain.<br /><br />Then breakfast was taken about eight o&#8217;clock,<br />And when over, each man stood in the ranks as firm as a rock,<br />And every man seemed to be on his guard &#8211;<br />All silent and ready to move forward.<br /><br />The first movement was a short one from where they lay &#8211;<br />Then they began to advance towards El-Teb without dismay,<br />And showed that all was in order for the fray,<br />While every man&#8217;s heart seemed to feel light and gay.<br /><br />The enemy&#8217;s position could be seen in the distance far away<br />But the brave heroes marched on without delay &#8211;<br />Whilst the enemy&#8217;s banners floated in the air,<br />And dark swarms of men were scattered near by there.<br /><br />Their force was a large one &#8211; its front extended over a mile,<br />And all along the line their guns were all in file;<br />But as the British advanced, they disappeared,<br />While our brave kilty lads loudly cheered.<br /><br />Thus slowly and cautiously brave General Graham proceeded<br />And to save his men from slaughter, great caution was needed,<br />Because Osman Digna&#8217;s force was about ten thousand strong;<br />But he said, Come on, my brave lads, we&#8217;ll conquer them ere long!<br /><br />It was about ten o&#8217;clock when they came near the enemy&#8217;s lines,<br />And on the morning air could be heard the cheerful chimes<br />Corning from the pipes of the gallant Black Watch,<br />Which every ear in the British force was eager to catch.<br /><br />Then they passed by the enemy about mid-day,<br />While every Arab seemed to have his gun ready for the fray<br />When a bullet strikes down General Baker by the way,<br />But he is soon in the saddle again without delay,<br /><br />And ready for any service that he could perform;<br />Whilst the bullets fell around them in a perfect storm<br />That they had to lie down, but not through fear,<br />Because the enemy was about 800 yards on their left rear.<br /><br />Then General Graham addressed his men,<br />And said, If they won&#8217;t attack us, we must attack them,<br />So start to your feet, my lads, and never fear,<br />And strike up your bagpipes, and give a loud cheer.<br /><br />So they leapt to their feet, and gave a loud cheer,<br />While the Arabs swept down upon them without the least fear,<br />And put aside their rifles, and grasped their spears;<br />Whilst the British bullets in front of them the earth uptears.<br /><br />Then the British charged them with their cold steel,<br />Which made the Arabs backward for to reel;<br />But they dashed forward again on their ranks without dismay,<br />But before the terrible fire of their musketry they were swept away.<br /><br />Oh, God of Heaven! it was a terrible sight<br />To see, and hear the Arabs shouting with all their might<br />A fearful oath when they got an inch of cold steel,<br />Which forced them backwards again and made them reel.<br /><br />By two o&#8217;clock they were fairly beat,<br />And Osman Digna, the false prophet, was forced to retreat<br />After three hours of an incessant fight;<br />But Heaven, &#8216;tis said, defends the right.<br /><br />And I think he ought to be ashamed of himself;<br />For I consider he has acted the part of a silly elf,<br />By thinking to conquer the armies of the Lord<br />With his foolish and benighted rebel horde.<br /></blockquote></div>

Political correctness aside, this relic is a  jewel in the glorious art of story-tell. Bivouack in peace, McGonagall; what&#8217;s a fatwa to a dead poet&#8230;</div>

Beautiful Summer now hath fled,<br />And the face of Nature doth seem dead,<br />And the leaves are withered, and falling off the trees,<br />By the nipping and chilling autumnal breeze.<br /><br />The pleasures of the little birds are all fled,<br />And with the cold many of them will be found dead,<br />Because the leaves of the trees are scattered in the blast,<br />And makes the feathered creatures feel downcast.<br /><br />Because there are no leaves on the trees to shield them from the storm<br />On a windy, and rainy, cloudy morn;<br />Which makes their little hearts throb with pain,<br />By the chilling blast and the pitiless rain.<br /><br />But still they are more contented than the children of God,<br />As long as they can pick up a worm from the sod,<br />Or anything they can get to eat,<br />Just, for instance, a stale crust of bread or a grain of wheat.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the little birds in the time of the snow,<br />Also of the little street waifs, that are driven to and fro,<br />And trembling in the cold blast, and chilled to the bone,<br />For the want of food and clothing, and a warm home.<br /><br />Besides think of the sorrows of the wandering poor,<br />That are wandering in the cold blast from door to door;<br />And begging, for Heaven&#8217;s sake, a crust of bread,<br />And alas! Not knowing where to lay their head.<br /><br />While the rich are well fed and covered from the cold,<br />While the poor are starving, both young and old;<br />Alas! It is the case in this boasted Christian land,<br />Where as the rich are told to be kind to the poor, is God&#8217;s command.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the working man when he&#8217;s no work to do,<br />Who&#8217;s got a wife and family, perhaps four or two,<br />And the father searching for work, and no work can be had,<br />The thought, I&#8217;m sure, &#8216;tis enough to drive the poor man mad.<br /><br />Because for his wife and family he must feel,<br />And perhaps the thought thereof will cause him to steal<br />Bread for his family, that are starving at home,<br />While the thought thereof makes him sigh heavily and groan.<br /><br />Alas! The pangs of hunger are very hard to hide,<br />And few people can their temper control,<br />Or become reconciled to their fate,<br />Especially when they cannot find anything to eat.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the struggles of the poor to make a living,<br />Because the rich unto them seldom are giving;<br />Wereas they are told he that giveth to the poor lendeth unto the Lord,<br />But alas! they rather incline their money to hoard.<br /><br />Then theres the little news-vendors in the street,<br />Running about perhaps with bare feet;<br />And if the rich chance to see such creatures in the street,<br />In general they make a sudden retreat.<br /></blockquote><br /><hr /><span style="font-size:85%;"><br />Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deniscollette/1582876153/">Denis Collette on Flickr</a>.</span></div>

Great advise Arthur.<br /><br />One blog I quite like is i.g.spong.com written by a mate (and former announcer) of mine. He also uses his blog for 1 minute radio spots, so he usually limits them to 140 words. It helps to keep them pithy.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve tried to restrain myself to a definite theme or topic and within that take a subject and relate it to something that&#8217;s happened recently (in the news or to me personally). This usually means ignoring large areas of personal interest (e.g. media and politics), but can still allow me to deal with the issues behind them.<br /><br />*Ramble Ends*<br /><br />(I&#8217;d be up for tag teaming).</div>

It took me a while to get going. If you are writing for a readership, it does have to be very regular. A few things seem to help:<br /><br />- Tag-teaming with someone<br /><br />- Building up a backlog of drafts and ideas (even if they don&#8217;t get published, it all goes into the mill)<br /><br />- Blogging around central topics/themes rather than random personal junk from my head<br /><br />- Stuff that other people are keen to hear about<br /><br />See http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/07/19/the-4-pillars-of-writing-exceptional-blogs/<br /><br />Arthur</div>

			Mondays With McGonagall: Ode to Edward VII</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class='post'>
This week&#8217;s McGonagall (late, I know – I&#8217;m sorry) is an ode that William wrote for the coronation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom">Edward VII</a> of England. My guess is he&#8217;d been itching to write a coronation poem for years, having spent most of his career during the long reign of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>.<br /><hr/><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg/433px-Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg"><br/><img style="margin: 60pt 20pt 10px 20px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 216px; height: 300px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg/433px-Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><blockquote><br />Oh! God, I thank Thee for restoring King Edward the Seventh&#8217;s health again,<br />And let all his subjects throughout the Empire say Amen;<br />May God guard him by night and day,<br />At home and abroad, when he&#8217;s far away.<br /><br />May angels guard his bed at night when he lies down,<br />And may his subjects revere him, and on him do not frown;<br />May he be honoured by them at home and abroad,<br />And may he always be protected by the Eternal God.<br /><br />My blessing on his noble form, and on his lofty head,<br />May all good angels guard him while living and when dead;<br />And when the final hour shall come to summons him away,<br />May his soul be wafted to the realms of bliss I do pray.<br /><br />Long may he reign, happy and serene,<br />Also his Queen most beautiful to be seen;<br />And may God guard his family by night and day,<br />That they may tread in the paths of virtue and not go astray.<br /><br />May God prosper King Edward the Seventh wherever he goes,<br />May he always reign victorious over his foes;<br />Long may he be spared to wear the British Crown,<br />And may God be as a hedge around him at night when he lies down;<br />May God inspire him with wisdom, and long may he reign<br />As Emperor of India and King Edward the VII. &#8211;Amen.<br /></blockquote></div>

A half-century of mulling it over pre-coronation seems to have paid off for the poet. The third stanza almost scans, giving this poem a timely and uncharacteristically polished edge.</div>

More from William&#8217;s autobiography this week, except this is a poem, with the somewhat hubristic title <i>Magnificent Poem on Loch Leven</i>:<br /><hr/><br /><br /><blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>Beautiful Loch Leven, near by Kinross,<br />     For a good day&#8217;s fishing the angler is seldom at a loss,<br />     For the loch it abounds with pike and trout,<br />     Which can be had for the catching without any doubt;<br />     And the scenery around it is most beautiful to be seen,<br />     Especially the Castle, wherein was imprisoned Scotland&#8217;s ill-starred Queen.</p><p>Then there&#8217;s the lofty Lomond Hills on the eastern side,<br />     And the loch is long, very deep, very wide;<br />     Then on the southern side there&#8217;s Benarty&#8217;s rugged hills,<br />     And from the tops can be seen the village of Kinross with its spinning       mills.</p><p>The big house of Kinross is very handsome to be seen,<br />     With its beautiful grounds around it, and lime trees so green,<br />     And &#8216;tis a magnificent sight to see, on a fine summer afternoon<br />     The bees extracting honey from the leaves when in full bloom.</p>        <p>There the tourist can enjoy himself and while away the hours,<br />     Underneath the lime trees shady bowers,<br />     And listen to the humming of the busy bees,<br />     While they are busy gathering honey from the lime trees.</p>        <p>Then there&#8217;s the old burying ground near by Kinross,<br />     And the dead that lie there turned into dusty dross,<br />     And the gravestones are all in a state of decay,<br />     And the wall around it is mouldering away.</p></blockquote><br /><br /><script type="text/javascript"><br />var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?

Whether it&#8217;s trains, queens or lochs, he succeeds in ending his poems with a death theme. Macabre achievements aside, he is right of course about the scenery. It deserves a magnificent poem. Bring it on.</div>

Mr McGonagall&#8217;s understanding of pollination is interesting: &#8220;The bees extracting honey from the LEAVES when in full bloom.&#8221;</div>

My latest &#8220;week without caffeine&#8221; push has finally finished.<br /><br />As has proven to be the case most times I&#8217;ve done this, day 3 and 4 were the worst, although the ways my body has rebelled have varied. This time, I didn&#8217;t get the migraines that I did the first time I detoxed, but I did have almost constant low-grade dull headaches. On day 4 (Wednesday), I found it almost impossible to focus on anything, felt irritable, restless – it was like I&#8217;d drunk a bottle of red cordial neat. I can&#8217;t imagine what it would be like to have to battle that every single day :S<br /><br />The picture in this post is my tribute to the hot drink that helped me get through the 168 hours of torture: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos">Rooibos</a>. Unlike tea, rooibos is completely caffeine-free, but is still rich in minerals &amp; anti-oxidants. I think it may be in my top 3 hot drinks now (sorry, green tea!), and I expect to be drinking a lot more of it in the future.<br /><br />Okay, now I&#8217;m off for a cuppa, see y&#8217;all later!<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" >Photo Creative Commons: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ravissant74/534058328/">wilnora on flickr</a></span></div>

			Mondays With McGonagall: Peas</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class='post'>
This week&#8217;s Monday with McGonagall comes from his autobiographical writings, and explains his first performance-related encounter with peas…<br /><br /><hr /><br /><blockquote><br /><p><br />My Dearly Beloved Readers, – I will begin with giving an account of my experiences amongst the publicans. Well, I must say that the first man who threw peas at me was a publican, while I was giving an entertainment to a few of my admirers in a public-house in a certain little village not far from Dundee but, my dear friends, I wish it to be understood that the publican who threw the peas at me was not the     landlord of the public-house, he was one of the party who came to hear me give my entertainment.<br /></p><p>Well, my dear readers, it was while I was singing my own song, <i>The Rattling Boy from Dublin Town</i>, that he threw the peas at me. You must understand that the Rattling Boy was courting a lass called Biddy Brown, and the Rattling Boy chanced to meet his Biddy one night in company with another lad called Barney Magee, which, of course, he did not like to see, and he told Biddy he considered it too bad for her to be going about with another lad, and he would bid her good-bye for being untrue to him. Then Barney Magee told the Rattling Boy that Biddy Brown was his lass, and that he could easily find another – and come and have a glass, and be friends. </p><p>But the Rattling Boy told Barney Magee to give his glass of strong drink to the devil! meaning, I suppose, it was only fit for devils to make use of, not for God&#8217;s creatures. Because, my friends, too often has strong drink been the cause of seducing many a beautiful young woman away from her true lover, and from her parents also, by a false seducer which, no doubt, the Rattling Boy considered Barney Magee to be.</p><p> Therefore, my dear friends, the reason, I think, for the publican throwing the peas at me is because I say, to the devil with your glass, in my song, <i>The Rattling Boy from Dublin</i>, and he, no doubt, considered it had a teetotal tendency about it, and, for that reason, he had felt angry, and had thrown the peas at me.</p></blockquote></div>

A Rattling Boy? So he makes a sound like a rattle? No wonder Biddy hit the bottle.</div>

Unfortunately, my love for caffeinated goodness often means my consumption goes up in direct proportion to my busyness levels, until I find myself drinking too much of the stuff.<br /><br />Not being the sort of person that&#8217;s really capable of doing anything by halves (including coffee drinking), I combat this by going on caffeine fasts, where I&#8217;ll not drink anything caffeinated for a period of time (usually a week). As I sit here with a nearly-empty thermos of plunger coffee, I can&#8217;t help but think that it&#8217;s time for another one.<br /><br />So as of midnight tonight, I&#8217;ll be completely off caffeine (in any form: tea, coffee, chocolate, energy drinks, whatever) for the entire week. Usually by day 3, my body goes into full-scale rebellion, and tries to make life miserable. Thankfully there aren&#8217;t any uni classes this week.<br /><br />Wish me luck…<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarandweedkiller/1118758309/"><span style="font-size:78%;"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Photo Creative Commons: </span></span></a><span class="nickname"><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarandweedkiller/1118758309/"><span style="font-size:78%;">GIRLintheCAFE on Flickr</span></a><br /></span></div>

I too am dancing at the door of caffeine&#8217;s hold. Not one week passes by without a cup of Earl Grey. It&#8217;s going to take me some time to finish the best price-per-unit purchase of a box of 100 tea bags.<BR/><BR/>Good luck.</div>
