New year, new poem! Wrote this after coming back from a trip to the Middle East. Spent some time with people I barely knew (but now consider good friends) tooling around sightseeing and attempting to be make the world a better place. We did do some openly Christian stuff, but some of the images that stuck the most closely to me are from time we spent in a Palestinian refugee camp in Bourj Al-Barajneh, Beirut. There&#8217;s a great NGO called the <a href="http://inmafoundation.org">Inma Foundation</a> we were able to volunteer with; painting, cleaning, and decorating their centre within the camp. Check them out. I could try and spend words and words and words explaining the plight of these refugees – but maybe you need to go educate yourself as well :). Too many words, not enough poetry!<br /><hr/><br /><blockquote><br />I saw a truck driving through Bourj Al-Barajneh Camp<br />  It carried a load of rubble<br />  And a set of keys to a dream<br />  that will never be realised.<br />  <br />I saw a man walking through Bourj Al-Barajneh Camp<br />  His body wasn&#8217;t staying still<br />  But his soul was firmly stuck <br />  in that box of concrete, wires and despair. <br />  <br />I saw children playing in Bourj Al-Barajneh Camp<br />  They weren&#8217;t running, excited,<br />  Full of joy and light because<br />  They didn&#8217;t know they were allowed.<br />  <br />I saw a Son of Man in Bourj Al-Barajneh Camp<br />  He said He had plans for His children,<br />  For a hope and for a future.<br />  I&#8217;m glad Somebody does at least.<br /></blockquote></div>

I&#8217;ve not really posted for a while; I guess this isn&#8217;t exactly the most exciting thing I try and do. Life is too full of interacting with people so I keep forgetting to come here and gush whatever&#8217;s on my mind. But whatever. Maybe more this year. Maybe.</div>

Recently I had a friend apologise for a comment they&#8217;d made in a social setting – they were worried that they had offended and/or hurt me with what they&#8217;d said. I couldn&#8217;t actually remember the offending remark, but was thankful that they wanted to make things right. I told them that I was sure they didn&#8217;t mean anything by whatever they had said (which was true), and the conversation ended amicably. <br /><br />That should have been the end of it, right? Genuine apology, accepted with genuine thanks and genuine assurances that everything was fine – all good!<br /><br />And yet it was all I could do to stop myself trying to remember what it was they might have said! In the end I gave myself a stern talking-to about the self-indulgence of such an activity.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to repent from such emotional hypochondria. Perhaps we like sinfully wallowing in self-pity (&#8220;they hurt me! they hurt me!&#8221;). Or maybe we just want to inflate our ego via forgiveness (&#8220;wow, I was so gracious when I forgave that person&#8221;). Either way, Lord, thank You for forgiving us our sins, even as we learn to forgive those who sin against us…</div>

<a href="http://www.christchurchhawthorn.org/">The church I attend</a> has just had its vicar leave to go take up a role at a church in Canada, and today was the second Sunday since he left. We&#8217;ve been appointed a locum (stand-in), Graeme Sells, to help keep the church running while we look for a replacement.<br /><br />Today was his first Sunday with us, and I think his sermon spoke right to the heart of where our minds and hearts need to be as a congregation. He took the question that will inevitably be in our minds (and especially those tasked with the responsibility of finding a suitable replacement) and turned them around: rather than &#8220;What do we expect from a vicar?&#8221; (pastor, minister, priest, whatever), what should they hope to find when they get here?<br /><br />Graeme chose to look at <a href="http://esv.to/Ac2.42-47">Acts 2:42-47</a>, looking at the early church and deriving positives from this picture. He came up with 9 things churches should aim to be:<br /><br /><dl><dt>A Learning Church</dt><dd>The early church didn&#8217;t have any New Testament to start off with – they had the Old Testament, and the teaching of the apostles. They didn&#8217;t have easy access to the Scriptures of the Old Testament, so they had to make sure they listened well when they were taught. (Acts also says that a lot of them spent time in the Temple courts learning every day!)</dd><dt>Committed to Fellowship</dt><dd>I think this one is the one that gets the most attention when people come to this passage: the community of believers, sharing lives, meeting each others&#8217; needs. As a church models this behaviour, its members grow and serve with each other, and become closer-knit. The sacrament of Communion also provides fellowship between the church (corporately and individually speaking) and Christ.<sup><a href="#aside">†</a></sup></dd><dt>Committed to Prayer</dt><dd>And not just any prayer, but especially prayer for the well-being of the church, its health and its growth. Times between shepherds are often times of uncertainty, so the sheep must pay even more attention to the Chief Shepherd than they usually do. To that end, CCH will be having some prayer nights completely dedicated to praying for precisely these things.</dd><dt>A Reverant Church</dt><dd>It&#8217;s all too easy for a church to take itself too seriously, and not take God seriously enough. The reverse should be the case. We should give God the respect He deserves, and be prepared to reflect and receive wisdom and criticism about areas we need to improve on.</dd><dt>A Church that God uses</dt><dd>Attitude does play a part. God wants the church to be engaged with his mission for the world, and if we ask God to use us, and we&#8217;re seeking to honour Him, then He will answer that prayer. There are times when God seems less active than others, but prayers to be used of God from a right heart won&#8217;t go unanswered.</dd><dt>A Generous Church</dt><dd>Barnabas, we read elsewhere in Acts, sold a block of land and gave all the proceeds to the church to use. A church where every member is actively looking for ways to give (time, talents, and treasures) is a rich church indeed, and one that is best resourced to serve and minister to its surrounding community.</dd><dt>Takes Worship Seriously</dt><dd>Worship for the early church would have been an interesting exercise – worshipping One who many of them would have known quite well would have been a very intimate thing. We in the 21<sup>st</sup> century don&#8217;t have that benefit, but the Holy Spirit allows us to worship intimately with both Father and Son.</dd><dt>A Happy Church</dt><dd>When a church is attuned to what God is doing, the natural response is one of praise to Him for His goodness and greatness. How hard are we looking for God&#8217;s hand in our everyday lives (in the big things and the small things)? This doesn&#8217;t mean that genuine sorrow and pain should be wallpapered over, not at all; but even in times of great suffering, we can still affirm the greatness and the goodness of God.</dd><dt>A Caring Church</dt><dd>A church always has those within it who are in greater need of care than others. Ultimately, every Christian is a fundamentally weak person whom God has strengthened and comforted in some way; so how can we fail to use what God has given us to strengthen and comfort others? Graeme shared some great practical insights on this one, showing examples of how churches were able to care for those with disabilities, or those whose lives had been shattered by natural disaster. </dd></dl><br />Finally, verse 47 shows what a church striving for these things can hope for: a healthy, growing community. It&#8217;s churches like these that are the best advertisement for Christianity &ndash; no room for hypocrisy, vitally living faith in practice. The gospel will always be a stumbling-block and foolishness to unbelievers; but those whom God is saving will be attracted to this kind of community.<br /><br />How does your church stack up? What are its strengths? Where can it improve?<br />And given that churches are comprised of individuals, how are you helping make this picture a reality in your church?<br /><br /><hr /><a name="aside"></a>†&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, the sermon I heard this morning touched on Jesus&#8217; ascension. One of the points the preacher made was that if Jesus hadn&#8217;t ascended, He would not have sent the Holy Spirit, who ministers to every Christian individually in a way that Jesus could not as a full human. I hadn&#8217;t thought of that, and it made a lot of sense.</div>

I don&#8217;t know why. There&#8217;s something unnerving about a lack of aural stimulation. As I sit writing this, I can hear the buzz of the fluoro tube above my head, the rumble of a distant tram passing, a lone dog&#8217;s bark, and the sound of my fingers punching at the keys. Even in this stillest of scenes there is sound.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve often wondered why I find silence so distasteful. What does the lack of sound signify that makes me want to fill it with something, anything?<br /><br />Maybe reversing the question will make it easier to answer. Why do I like noise, sound, music? Many reasons: the Beauty of rhythm. The aural masterpieces painted by timbre, melody, harmony, and even just plain noise. I like seeing order in seeming chaos: extracting a rhythm from sound waves, fluid progress of chords, patterns of intervals. Even in the absence of music, there is wonder to be experienced. When I walk through the city, I love to detune my ears, and let the spacial aspect of sound thrill me; the uncomposed masterpiece of audio engineering that is my immediate surroundings. I find some affinity with the avant-garde composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage">John Cage</a>, who finds sound fascinating:<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pcHnL7aS64Y&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pcHnL7aS64Y&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Cage claims to love silence. It&#8217;s not real silence, though; for him, traffic noise counts as silence.<br />Indeed, Cage&#8217;s most well-known work, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4′33″">4&#8217;33&#8221;</a>, is not completely silent. The audience is encouraged to discover music in the sounds of their environment, rather than in the ordered structure of a musical score. No two &#8220;performmances&#8221; are alike, as each carries the unique tones and murmurings of the moments it occupies.<br /><br />The Tremeloes might have thought that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyj2qL-bQ4E">silence was golden</a>, but I find it stark. What&#8217;s your reaction to silence? I think I have more to say, but it hasn&#8217;t crystallized in my head yet – you&#8217;ll just have to sit quietly and wait…<br /><br /><hr/><br /><small><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bixentro/965756257/">Photo: Bixentro on flickr</a></small></div>

In contrast to life, there hasn&#8217;t been much happening here of late. Sorry!<br /><br />However, I have just started a blog relating to the Research Project I&#8217;ve started at Swinburne.<br /><br />You can read about what I&#8217;m doing over at <a href="http://thegloofactory.blogspot.com">The GLoo Factory</a>.

As I always do, I visited their account pages and looked for those I might be interested in following back. Unlike many Twitter users I know, I don&#8217;t automatically follow every non-spam account that follows me: I look for people and organisations that I can interact with, converse with, gain value from.<br /><br />Of late, I&#8217;m seeing a lot of accounts that just seem, well, odd. I pondered this <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewdotnich/status/5888170506">out</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewdotnich/status/5888190478">loud</a>, and when <a href="http://twitter.com/tdmalone">Tim Malone</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/tdmalone/status/5888274075">asked me what I meant</a>, I thought I&#8217;d try and distill my thinking into something coherent.<br /><br />There are a number of things these odd-looking accounts have in common:<br /><br /><ol><li>The accounts have a real person&#8217;s name attached</li><li>The backgrounds advertise a company or an organisation</li><li>Their tweet streams don&#8217;t fit either profile</li></ol><br />Let me explain what I mean:<br /><br /><ol><li>This isn&#8217;t unusual at all, and by itself doesn&#8217;t mean much — in fact, I expect most twitter accounts to have a real person on the other end. However, if I follow a personal account, I expect the way they tweet to reflect their personality, who they are, how they think. This is partly what makes Twitter such a rich online experience: opinions, conversations, jokes, games – there&#8217;s always something going on.</li><li>I have no problem with corporate twitter accounts per sé: if you&#8217;re using social media and networks to spread your company, good on you for being proactive! I follow a number of companies / organisations that I support, because they are focused and provide me with information and interaction that I wouldn&#8217;t get otherwise. It provides a central point of contact for customer service, and makes hearing from these organisations easier. If I follow a company, I expect their tweets to be about services they offer, responses to customer feedback, or content that directly pertains to them.</li><li>What makes these accounts so strange to me is that they try to be both, and end up being neither. I don&#8217;t expect a person tweeting as themselves to plaster advertising all over their Twitter page. On the other hand, I don&#8217;t expect a company account to post quotes or links to online news stories that are of limited relevance to their organisation.<br /></li></ol><br />I am not a Social Media Expert (thank goodness!) But I do offer these suggestions under the umbrella of Common Sense:<br /><br /><strong>If you&#8217;re a person:</strong> don&#8217;t <em>sell</em> yourself, <em>be</em> yourself. If you&#8217;re a professional, no one is going to hire/collaborate/communicate with you because of your awesome Twitter background that contains half your resume. They&#8217;re going to do those things because of how you act and interact online (just as they do offline).<br /><br /><strong>If you&#8217;re a company:</strong> keep your tweets directly related to company material. I don&#8217;t expect a company to tell me about a news story, or give me an inspirational quote. I want to know what you&#8217;re doing, and how you&#8217;re making things better for your clients/customers. That doesn&#8217;t mean every 2nd tweet should flog your product, but it does mean stay on message.<br /><br />Decide what type of account you&#8217;re starting, and stick with that. If you want to do both, make two accounts.

We&#8217;ve had a few weeks without studies since the last update, what with a scheduled break and the mid-semester &#8220;holiday&#8221;. There&#8217;ve been a couple of studies in that time, though, so apologies for being a bit behind.<br /><br />First one is by Jeff, an introductory look at the highly controversial topic of gender roles (especially inside the church). <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/Gender%20Roles%20Study%20%26%20notes.zip">Study + Notes [ZIP]</a><br /><br />The second one is one I took on Leadership in the Church, and Paul&#8217;s teachings on the sorts of leaders churches deserve to have. <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/Qualifications.pdf">Study [PDF]</a><br /><br />I hope these provoke questions and thoughts as you go through them :)<br /><br />EDIT: Oops, Jeff&#8217;s study notes are in a zip file, not a PDF. Fixed&#8230;</div>

Thanks for taking the time to post these studies during your busy month. The studies are fabulous. They give clear guidance on a wide range of specifics. Yet their very clarity jars on some people&#8230;I suppose the verses insist we expose our position on Authority of Scripture, because they don&#39;t leave much grey area to hide in :)  Some respond by demanding we change scripture&#39;s view to match our modernity, rather than change ourselves to match scripture. Yet time and again, and without exception in the long-term, churches and families living under the Word bear the good fruit. I&#39;m confident that as the Word continues to be faithfully taught, the truth will defend itself in the outworkings of the lives of those following it. This gives us much challenge to rise to. I have to work on the QUIET part at times :)  Yet I take my hat off to you BLOKES&#8230; study #2 indicates you have the lion&#39;s share of the challenge. I pray you&#39;ll keep up the great work; the rest of us need, value &amp; depend on your Godly male leadership. Thanks again Andrew for the post&#8230;</div>

Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><br />Ouch.</div>

Pure joy. Not something that comes automatically - when do we ever rejoice in trials? I know that I too often forget that the words I read in the Word actually apply to real life. <br />Single-mindedness. They call it narrow-mindedness out there. But how else can we live, if we can&#39;t stick to one purpose - becoming more like Jesus? Waves of the sea, chaff that the wind blows away&#8230;<br />It is a challenge, praying with purpose and without doubt. Bless you, brother.</div>
