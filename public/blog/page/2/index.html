I love it when one stumbles across a gem. I found the Tenth Leper blog through a friend because of the recent Rob Bell unpleasantness, but I&#8217;ve kept him in my feeds now that his reviews are done because I really like the stuff he has to say. Take this from <a href="http://thetenthleper.com/2011/04/06/the-importance-of-christian-identity-in-the-fight-against-sin/">today&#8217;s post</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>I think some of Satan’s biggest victories against us are not in his getting us to commit a particular sin, but in increasing our guilt over it.  It’s like that old proverb: “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.”  Similarly, get a man to sin and you’ll separate him from God for a moment.  But get a man to feel guilty, and you’ll separate him from God forever.  Guilt causes us to believe that God doesn’t want us, that his arms aren’t open to us, that his attention can’t be grabbed except by maybe extreme effort.  It causes us to believe that we’re damaged goods and that God couldn’t possibly still want us.<br /><p>I don’t think it’s too bold to say that the moments after sin can be more dangerous than the moments before it.  How you respond to sin is so important.  Will you move further away from your only source of life and help as a result of it?  Or will you move closer to him?  We need to preach the Gospel to ourselves every day because we sin every day, and the more we sin, the more we’re reminded that on our own we have absolutely no right to speak with God.  But we need to let that drive us to Jesus as our only right to be in the presence of God.  Jesus killed sin’s guilt.  And because there’s no longer any guilt or condemnation for God’s children, then sin’s power begins to diminish in their lives, because they’re confidently running to their Father for strength.<br /></blockquote><br />Where do you run?</div>

No, not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQT0t2s1MoE">the song</a>!<br /><br />I went for a bike ride on Friday night; no reason, I just felt like upping and heading onto the road. I turned off Wellington Parade into Yarra Park, cruising past the MCG when a bridge caught my eye. The bridge takes its pedestrian passengers over the Jolimont railway lines and across into Birrarung Marr. I imagine that it&#8217;s a well-known route, but I&#8217;d never been over it, so I rode towards it and decided to stop at the top to enjoy the view.<br /><br />While I was sitting there on a bench, I was treated to an amazing aural experience. There are speakers embedded in the walls of the bridge, and they were playing an intoxicating mix of folk music from all different cultures. I sat entranced at the sensory spectacle; the beautiful city lights of Melbourne in front of me, the glow of the &#8216;G behind me, the yellow lights on the bridge giving an other-worldly light to my surroundings, and the music of different cultures blending in sweet cacophony over the rumble of the trains passing underneath. <br /><br />It occurred to me that this was a little taste of what Heaven will be like - the music, rhythm, language and expression of every tribe, nation, culture, all gathered together in joyous expression of praise to God. And while I can&#8217;t wait for that day to come (and come quick, Lord Jesus!) I&#8217;m really grateful for little sneak peaks like this :)</div>

Over at my new friend Kim&#8217;s blog <a href="http://refiningthebrew.blogspot.com/">Just Add Tea</a>, she recently <a href="http://refiningthebrew.blogspot.com/2011/02/true-community-life-hard-reality.html">shared some things</a> she&#8217;d been learning about community:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote>[Citing an article] [I]t&#8217;s what followed that struck me most: &#8220;Somewhere along the lines we have lost the concept of true community and our lives are now focused purely on ourselves, our needs and those in our circle of close friends and family. We rarely give any time to those outside the circle unless it&#8217;s convenient for us. (Oh the pain and shame, as I just saw me in this reality.) We don&#8217;t like to be inconvenienced. <b>But how can we help people if we are never prepared to be inconvenienced? How can we help people if we are never prepared to be uncomfortable?&#8221;</b></blockquote><br /><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/20/70750719_4487c32bb0.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/20/70750719_4487c32bb0.jpg" width="240" /></a>Since I&#8217;ve got back from overseas, I&#8217;ve been forced to think about the flip-side of that coin. Pride is a funny sin; it seems to be able to take over both sides. I love helping people; I&#8217;m a people person, and I get great personal joy &amp; satisfaction from getting alongside others and pulling with them to get something done. But I&#8217;m a terrible people-pleaser too; the idea of letting somebody down terrifies me (although more on that in a second).<br /><br />This came to a head for me when I tried to do everything I had been doing after a draining month of travel. I survived a week and a half, then crunched into a wall when I realised I simply couldn&#8217;t keep doing all the things I&#8217;d been doing.<br /><br />What to do? Who to say &#8220;Sorry, but I can&#8217;t&#8221; to? I HATE saying no to people! What will they think of me? Ah, ahhh. There&#8217;s the rub. There&#8217;s pride, poking its face around the corner. Pride, telling me that what people think of me is actually the most important reason to serve. How twisted *bah*<br /><br />I&#8217;m learning to rest; hopefully there&#8217;ll be another post about that soon. But how does this relate to Kim&#8217;s reflections above?<br /><br />Well, I&#8217;m realising the corollary to Kim&#8217;s point. Just as truly being part of a community means letting yourself be inconvenienced in order to love others, you must also <b>let others inconvenience themselves (or be inconvenienced) in order to love you.</b> To fail to do so is just another way that pride creeps in and taints our lives.<br /><br />So here&#8217;s to repentance. Here&#8217;s to being humble enough to say no. To being humble enough to let someone else help carry your burdens when things are heavy. To bearing each other&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfilling the love of Christ. To the community of God&#8217;s family :)<br /><br /><hr/>Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimbaker/70750719/">A helping hand</a> by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimbaker/">Forest Runner on flickr</a>.

Just noticed that over at last.fm I&#8217;d notched up 33,333 song listens. Who cares. Here is the 33,333rd song I scrobbled. It&#8217;s kind of fitting, as I&#8217;ve really enjoyed this song again of late :)<br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0Rdn1VZxo_E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
