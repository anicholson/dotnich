It doesn&#8217;t seem to be a particularly important battle on the world stage (particularly for the residents of Dundee, or indeed anywhere), but thanks to his efforts, we can learn about it in a form other than prose&#8230;<br /><br /><hr /><br /><h2>The Battle Of El-Teb</h2><br /><blockquote><br /><br />Ye sons of Great Britain, I think no shame<br />To write in praise of brave General Graham!<br />Whose name will be handed down to posterity without any stigma,<br />Because, at the battle of El-Teb, he defeated Osman Digna.<br /><br />With an army about five thousand strong,<br />To El-Teb, in the year 1884, he marched along,<br />And bivouacked there for the night;<br />While around their fires they only thought of the coming fight.<br /><br />They kept up their fires all the long night,<br />Which made the encampment appear weird-like to the sight;<br />While the men were completely soaked with the rain,<br />But the brave heroes disdained to complain.<br /><br />The brave heroes were glad when daylight did appear,<br />And when the reveille was sounded, they gave a hearty cheer<br />And their fires were piled up higher again,<br />Then they tried to dry their clothes that were soaked with the rain.<br /><br />Then breakfast was taken about eight o&#8217;clock,<br />And when over, each man stood in the ranks as firm as a rock,<br />And every man seemed to be on his guard &#8211;<br />All silent and ready to move forward.<br /><br />The first movement was a short one from where they lay &#8211;<br />Then they began to advance towards El-Teb without dismay,<br />And showed that all was in order for the fray,<br />While every man&#8217;s heart seemed to feel light and gay.<br /><br />The enemy&#8217;s position could be seen in the distance far away<br />But the brave heroes marched on without delay &#8211;<br />Whilst the enemy&#8217;s banners floated in the air,<br />And dark swarms of men were scattered near by there.<br /><br />Their force was a large one &#8211; its front extended over a mile,<br />And all along the line their guns were all in file;<br />But as the British advanced, they disappeared,<br />While our brave kilty lads loudly cheered.<br /><br />Thus slowly and cautiously brave General Graham proceeded<br />And to save his men from slaughter, great caution was needed,<br />Because Osman Digna&#8217;s force was about ten thousand strong;<br />But he said, Come on, my brave lads, we&#8217;ll conquer them ere long!<br /><br />It was about ten o&#8217;clock when they came near the enemy&#8217;s lines,<br />And on the morning air could be heard the cheerful chimes<br />Corning from the pipes of the gallant Black Watch,<br />Which every ear in the British force was eager to catch.<br /><br />Then they passed by the enemy about mid-day,<br />While every Arab seemed to have his gun ready for the fray<br />When a bullet strikes down General Baker by the way,<br />But he is soon in the saddle again without delay,<br /><br />And ready for any service that he could perform;<br />Whilst the bullets fell around them in a perfect storm<br />That they had to lie down, but not through fear,<br />Because the enemy was about 800 yards on their left rear.<br /><br />Then General Graham addressed his men,<br />And said, If they won&#8217;t attack us, we must attack them,<br />So start to your feet, my lads, and never fear,<br />And strike up your bagpipes, and give a loud cheer.<br /><br />So they leapt to their feet, and gave a loud cheer,<br />While the Arabs swept down upon them without the least fear,<br />And put aside their rifles, and grasped their spears;<br />Whilst the British bullets in front of them the earth uptears.<br /><br />Then the British charged them with their cold steel,<br />Which made the Arabs backward for to reel;<br />But they dashed forward again on their ranks without dismay,<br />But before the terrible fire of their musketry they were swept away.<br /><br />Oh, God of Heaven! it was a terrible sight<br />To see, and hear the Arabs shouting with all their might<br />A fearful oath when they got an inch of cold steel,<br />Which forced them backwards again and made them reel.<br /><br />By two o&#8217;clock they were fairly beat,<br />And Osman Digna, the false prophet, was forced to retreat<br />After three hours of an incessant fight;<br />But Heaven, &#8216;tis said, defends the right.<br /><br />And I think he ought to be ashamed of himself;<br />For I consider he has acted the part of a silly elf,<br />By thinking to conquer the armies of the Lord<br />With his foolish and benighted rebel horde.<br /></blockquote></div>

Political correctness aside, this relic is a  jewel in the glorious art of story-tell. Bivouack in peace, McGonagall; what&#8217;s a fatwa to a dead poet&#8230;</div>
