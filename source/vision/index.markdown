# My Professional Vision

> ["People donâ€™t buy _what you do_; people buy _why you do it_."][1]

Here are some aphorisms/phrases that serve as my professional vision. I plan to expand on each one - either with a link to the source (if it's not my idea, or if I can't say it better), or with a blog post.

* [Serve Those Who Serve Others][2]
* Keep Up With Technological Change
* Don't Follow Tech Just Because it's "the New Hotness"
* A Good Product/Project Can Defend Its Existence
