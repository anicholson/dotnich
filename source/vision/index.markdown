# My Professional Vision

> ["People donâ€™t buy _what you do_; people buy _why you do it_."][1]

Here are some aphorisms/phrases that serve as my professional vision; I plan to expand on each one. If it's not my idea, or if I can't say it better, I'll just link to the source.
Otherwise, I'll write up a post.

* [Serve Those Who Serve Others][2]
* Keep Up With Technological Change
* Don't Follow Tech Just Because it's "the New Hotness"
* A Good Product/Project Can Defend Its Existence
* Don't Build a Platform Until You Know What The Product Is
