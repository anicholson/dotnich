This week's McGonagall (late, I know â€“ I'm sorry) is an ode that William wrote for the coronation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom">Edward VII</a> of England. My guess is he'd been itching to write a coronation poem for years, having spent most of his career during the long reign of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>.<br /><hr/><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg/433px-Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg"><br/><img style="margin: 60pt 20pt 10px 20px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 216px; height: 300px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg/433px-Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><blockquote><br />Oh! God, I thank Thee for restoring King Edward the Seventh's health again,<br />And let all his subjects throughout the Empire say Amen;<br />May God guard him by night and day,<br />At home and abroad, when he's far away.<br /><br />May angels guard his bed at night when he lies down,<br />And may his subjects revere him, and on him do not frown;<br />May he be honoured by them at home and abroad,<br />And may he always be protected by the Eternal God.<br /><br />My blessing on his noble form, and on his lofty head,<br />May all good angels guard him while living and when dead;<br />And when the final hour shall come to summons him away,<br />May his soul be wafted to the realms of bliss I do pray.<br /><br />Long may he reign, happy and serene,<br />Also his Queen most beautiful to be seen;<br />And may God guard his family by night and day,<br />That they may tread in the paths of virtue and not go astray.<br /><br />May God prosper King Edward the Seventh wherever he goes,<br />May he always reign victorious over his foes;<br />Long may he be spared to wear the British Crown,<br />And may God be as a hedge around him at night when he lies down;<br />May God inspire him with wisdom, and long may he reign<br />As Emperor of India and King Edward the VII. --Amen.<br /></blockquote></div>

A half-century of mulling it over pre-coronation seems to have paid off for the poet. The third stanza almost scans, giving this poem a timely and uncharacteristically polished edge.</div>
