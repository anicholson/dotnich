<div class='post'>
I'll never forget the angel<br />&nbsp; flying down with cleansing fire<br />fire too hot to touch.<br /><br />My lips may be clean<br />&nbsp; but still there are times<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;when the scars smoulder with the memory.<br /><br />And so on I go<br />&nbsp; your searing stamp of approval<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the agony and the ecstasy<br />&nbsp;a reminder that   YHWH is Salvationâ€¦</div>
