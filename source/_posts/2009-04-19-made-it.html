My latest "week without caffeine" push has finally finished.<br /><br />As has proven to be the case most times I've done this, day 3 and 4 were the worst, although the ways my body has rebelled have varied. This time, I didn't get the migraines that I did the first time I detoxed, but I did have almost constant low-grade dull headaches. On day 4 (Wednesday), I found it almost impossible to focus on anything, felt irritable, restless â€“ it was like I'd drunk a bottle of red cordial neat. I can't imagine what it would be like to have to battle that every single day :S<br /><br />The picture in this post is my tribute to the hot drink that helped me get through the 168 hours of torture: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos">Rooibos</a>. Unlike tea, rooibos is completely caffeine-free, but is still rich in minerals &amp; anti-oxidants. I think it may be in my top 3 hot drinks now (sorry, green tea!), and I expect to be drinking a lot more of it in the future.<br /><br />Okay, now I'm off for a cuppa, see y'all later!<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" >Photo Creative Commons: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ravissant74/534058328/">wilnora on flickr</a></span></div>
