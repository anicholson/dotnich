"Are we so different?"<br />younger brother calls to elder.<br />"We both know the old dodderer<br />means well, but you've got to<br />admit He's a bit misguided.<br />We've got brains, we've got time -<br />let's go, see what <i>we</i> can do!"<br /><br />"Are you kidding?!"<br />rejoined the elder.<br />"We have a real base here! It's true<br />the Old Man is a bit tiresome, but <br />this farm's a solid investment!<br />Soon He'll die, and we can run things<br />the way they <i>should</i> be done! Or at least<br />not pretend so much&hellip;"<br /><br />So the younger ran out one way<br />and threw away his lot, while<br />the other toiled and strained and<br />worked long years on <br />his share of the plot.<br /><br />And all the while the Father grieved<br />for the day His two lost sons would<br />come back to His heart, and Home.</div>
