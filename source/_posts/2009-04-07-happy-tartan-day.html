As a proud bearer of a Scottish name, I thought it only fitting to use today to start something I'd been meaning to do for some time.<br /><br />It is my endeavour to post weekly excerpts of the works of William Topaz McGonagall, widely hailed as Scotland's (and possibly the world's) worst poet. I think that his work is greatly underappreciated, and if through this blog I can introduce more people to his magic, then I will be satisfied.<br /><br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the great bard, here is an excerpt from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Topaz_McGonagall" title="William Topaz McGonagall on Wikipedia">his entry on Wikipedia</a>:<br /><blockquote><br />Born in Edinburgh, of Irish parentage, McGonagall was working as a handloom weaver in Dundee, Scotland when an event occurred that was to change his life. As he was later to write: <dl><dd><i>The most startling incident in my life was the time I discovered myself to be a poet, which was in the year 1877.</i></dd></dl> <p>It was with this that he wrote his first poem <i>An Address to the Rev. George Gilfillan</i>, which showed all the hallmarks that would characterise his later work. Gilfillan commented "Shakespeare never wrote anything like this."</p> <p>McGonagall has been widely acclaimed as the worst poet in British history. The chief criticisms of his poetry are that he is deaf to poetic metaphor and unable to scan correctly. In the hands of lesser artists, this might simply generate dull, uninspiring verse. However, McGonagall's fame stems from the humorous effects these shortcomings generate. The inappropriate rhythms, weak vocabulary, and ill-advised imagery combine to make his work amongst the most spontaneously amusing comic poetry in the English language.</p></blockquote><hr /><br />Here, then, is the inaugural Monday with McGonagall (albeit incorrectly, and somehow appropriately, on a Tuesday):<br /><span style="font-size:130%;"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">A Requisition to the Queen</span></span><br /><div class="poem"><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:georgia;" name="KonaFilter" >Most August!

With the final stanza so delicately crafted, one can only dream of what the quality of the man's handloom weavings was like.</div>
