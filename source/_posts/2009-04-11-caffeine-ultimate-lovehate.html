Unfortunately, my love for caffeinated goodness often means my consumption goes up in direct proportion to my busyness levels, until I find myself drinking too much of the stuff.<br /><br />Not being the sort of person that's really capable of doing anything by halves (including coffee drinking), I combat this by going on caffeine fasts, where I'll not drink anything caffeinated for a period of time (usually a week). As I sit here with a nearly-empty thermos of plunger coffee, I can't help but think that it's time for another one.<br /><br />So as of midnight tonight, I'll be completely off caffeine (in any form: tea, coffee, chocolate, energy drinks, whatever) for the entire week. Usually by day 3, my body goes into full-scale rebellion, and tries to make life miserable. Thankfully there aren't any uni classes this week.<br /><br />Wish me luck…<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarandweedkiller/1118758309/"><span style="font-size:78%;"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Photo Creative Commons: </span></span></a><span class="nickname"><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sugarandweedkiller/1118758309/"><span style="font-size:78%;">GIRLintheCAFE on Flickr</span></a><br /></span></div>

I too am dancing at the door of caffeine's hold. Not one week passes by without a cup of Earl Grey. It's going to take me some time to finish the best price-per-unit purchase of a box of 100 tea bags.<BR/><BR/>Good luck.</div>
