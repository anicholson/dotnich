In contrast to life, there hasn't been much happening here of late. Sorry!<br /><br />However, I have just started a blog relating to the Research Project I've started at Swinburne.<br /><br />You can read about what I'm doing over at <a href="http://thegloofactory.blogspot.com">The GLoo Factory</a>. It assumes a fair amount of programming knowledge, so apologies if it doesn't make any sense :)<br /><br />A.</div>
