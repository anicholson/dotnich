<blockquote>When she had got to the third page [of another story] and come to the end, she said, "That is the loveliest story I've ever read or ever shall read in my whole life. Oh, I wish I could have gone on reading it for ten years. At least I'll read it over again."<br />But here part of the magic of the Book came into play. You couldn't turn back. The right-hand pages, the ones ahead, could be turned; the left-hand pages could not.<br />... "It was about a cup and a sword and a tree and a green hill, I know that much. But I can't remember, and what shall I do?"'<br /></blockquote>--C.S. Lewis, "Voyage of the Dawn Treader"</div>
