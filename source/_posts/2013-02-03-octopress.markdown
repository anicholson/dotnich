Over a year since my last post, and so I decided (in typical geek fashion) to reboot it by switching blogging platforms. So goodbye Blogger, and hello Octopress!
Octopress is a different kind of blog system than many -- there's no database, only flat files. You write a new post in a plain text file, run a command to create the generated page, and away you go! A little magic is required to serve it easily on the web (I'm using a service called Heroku, for the other nerd in the audience), but that's it!

I'm thinking a bit about what I want to write about - the things that interest me, as well as what I'm up to. As always, here's hoping it gets more love than the last effort :P

Hello 2013!
