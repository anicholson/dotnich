I talk a lotta talk but I don't<br />  walk a lotta walk,<br />I try to live to please You but I <br />  just can't shake the awk..ward..<br /><br />voice that nags and says "You know what?<br />  maybe take your eyes off you;<br />fix 'em firmly back on Jesus and<br />  remember&hellip;He <strong>loves</strong> you."<br /><br />"He loves you when the going's good, when<br />  all things come up Milhouse,<br />and just as much when things are grey,<br />  and all you feel is s&mdash;house!"<br /><br />"He knows you want to please Him<br />  so remember that you <em>do!</em><br />Now <strong>get out of your self-right funk</strong><br />  and go love others too&hellip;"</div>
