You're committed to finding joy in everything that the Lord shows you and takes you through, even if it doesn't fit with the plans you've supposedly laid down.<br /><br />The biggest struggle, then, is to keep from second-guessing. It really reminds me of the Israelites – they'd seen God's amazing hand in delivering them from slavery in Egypt. They'd seen plagues, miracles, and signs worthy of being passed down through the generations as examples of God's power and faithfulness  – but as soon as things got a little hard? They wanted their "control" back, to feel like they were in charge. They needed constant reminders (and more than a little discipline) to remind them of Who they depended on for their very existence.<br /><br />My prayer is to be able to echo these words of Chris Tomlin:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />All of You is more than enough for all of me<br />For every thirst and every need<br />You satisfy me with Your love<br />And all I have in You is more than enough<br /><br />You are my supply<br />My breath of life<br />And still more awesome than I know<br />You are my reward<br />worth living for<br />And still more awesome than I know<br /><br />All of You is more than enough for all of me<br />For every thirst and every need<br />You satisfy me with Your love<br />And all I have in You is more than enough<br /><br />You're my sacrifice<br />Of greatest price<br />And still more awesome than I know<br />You're the coming King<br />You are everything<br />And still more awesome than I know<br /><br />More than all I want<br />More than all I need<br />You are more than enough for me<br />More than all I know<br />More than all I can say<br />You are more than enough for me<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><hr/><br />Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96dpi/2241923654/in/set-72157600446937074/">96dpi on flickr</a></div>

This reminds me of how I felt going back to Uni to study law after living in Africa. The value systems here clashed with the way that I had learned to live. I struggled with the contradictions for a few years. Thankfully, as you said about the Israelites, God keeps reminding us of what we once knew. Truth can get buried in a grave...but it won't stay there.</div>
