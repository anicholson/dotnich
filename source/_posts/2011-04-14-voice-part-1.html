"Be still," the Voice said.<br />"Be still? Are you kidding?" I thought.<br /><br />I've got to get my<br />my views opined<br />doctrines aligned<br />vices maligned<br />sins disinclined<br /><br />My style designed<br />life plan outlined<br />hobbies defined<br />a wife to find<br />that You've assigned somewhere, presumably<br /><br />and bear in mind<br />I've got the daily grind<br />sucks out the zest, the lemon rind<br />of life that comes and perks the mind<br /><br />and all of these combined<br />just serve to take my bind<br />and wind it up<br />so this is why like most mankind<br />I'm disinclined<br />to lie inclined<br />and listen to<br />Your still, small Voice.</div>
