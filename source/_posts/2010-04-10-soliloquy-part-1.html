I don't know why. There's something unnerving about a lack of aural stimulation. As I sit writing this, I can hear the buzz of the fluoro tube above my head, the rumble of a distant tram passing, a lone dog's bark, and the sound of my fingers punching at the keys. Even in this stillest of scenes there is sound.<br /><br />I've often wondered why I find silence so distasteful. What does the lack of sound signify that makes me want to fill it with something, anything?<br /><br />Maybe reversing the question will make it easier to answer. Why do I like noise, sound, music? Many reasons: the Beauty of rhythm. The aural masterpieces painted by timbre, melody, harmony, and even just plain noise. I like seeing order in seeming chaos: extracting a rhythm from sound waves, fluid progress of chords, patterns of intervals. Even in the absence of music, there is wonder to be experienced. When I walk through the city, I love to detune my ears, and let the spacial aspect of sound thrill me; the uncomposed masterpiece of audio engineering that is my immediate surroundings. I find some affinity with the avant-garde composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage">John Cage</a>, who finds sound fascinating:<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pcHnL7aS64Y&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pcHnL7aS64Y&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Cage claims to love silence. It's not real silence, though; for him, traffic noise counts as silence.<br />Indeed, Cage's most well-known work, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4′33″">4'33"</a>, is not completely silent. The audience is encouraged to discover music in the sounds of their environment, rather than in the ordered structure of a musical score. No two "performmances" are alike, as each carries the unique tones and murmurings of the moments it occupies.<br /><br />The Tremeloes might have thought that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyj2qL-bQ4E">silence was golden</a>, but I find it stark. What's your reaction to silence? I think I have more to say, but it hasn't crystallized in my head yet – you'll just have to sit quietly and wait…<br /><br /><hr/><br /><small><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bixentro/965756257/">Photo: Bixentro on flickr</a></small></div>
