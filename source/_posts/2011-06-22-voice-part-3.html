<i>"Trust Me with all your heart,"</i> You said.<br /><i>"Why?"</i> I thought, repulsed.<br /><br /><i>"Don't rely on your own perspective,"</i> You said —<br />but that made no sense at all.<br /><br /><i>"Wherever you go, realize I'm there, working,"</i> You said.<br /><i>"What have you ever done for me?"</i> I retorted.<br /><br /><i>"I'll tell you where to go,"</i> You said.<br />And I thought <i>"I'm sure you will!"</i><br /><hr /><br />There was silence for a few seconds, as You quizzically raised an eyebrow to say <i>"Really? Not even you believe that!"</i><br /><br /><small><i>*sigh*</i></small>You were right, as usual. <br /><br />And then You leaned over, gave me a hug, and said <i>"Come on, let's go this way…"</i><br /><hr/><br /><small>(Proverbs 3:5,6; Malachi1:2a)</small></div>
