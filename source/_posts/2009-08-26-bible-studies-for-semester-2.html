I know earlier in the year I promised I'd put up the Bible Studies I was taking with Jeff for CU, but these never really eventuated. Sorry!<br /><br />This semester hopefully will be different :)<br /><br /><br />Jeff Reddan & myself are conducting Bible Studies on Paul's first letter to Timothy, on Tuesday afternoons. We've got roughly 5 people or so that have said they can come (although we've not yet had them all at once!), and it promises to be a really great time.<br /><br />Here's the first study as led by Jeff:<br /><br /><a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/Wk1%20-%20False%20Teaching.pdf">Week 1: False Teaching [PDF]</a><br /><br />UPDATE: Jeff's provided me with some more material for this study. <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/False%20Teaching%20notes.zip">[ZIP]</a></div>

Had a look at the week 1 slides... you guys are pretty organised! Looks great. I&#39;m a little annoyed I have a class which clashes with your study; otherwise I&#39;d come along.</div>
