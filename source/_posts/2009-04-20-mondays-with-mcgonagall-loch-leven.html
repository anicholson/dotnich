More from William's autobiography this week, except this is a poem, with the somewhat hubristic title <i>Magnificent Poem on Loch Leven</i>:<br /><hr/><br /><br /><blockquote style="text-align: center;"><p>Beautiful Loch Leven, near by Kinross,<br />     For a good day's fishing the angler is seldom at a loss,<br />     For the loch it abounds with pike and trout,<br />     Which can be had for the catching without any doubt;<br />     And the scenery around it is most beautiful to be seen,<br />     Especially the Castle, wherein was imprisoned Scotland's ill-starred Queen.</p><p>Then there's the lofty Lomond Hills on the eastern side,<br />     And the loch is long, very deep, very wide;<br />     Then on the southern side there's Benarty's rugged hills,<br />     And from the tops can be seen the village of Kinross with its spinning       mills.</p><p>The big house of Kinross is very handsome to be seen,<br />     With its beautiful grounds around it, and lime trees so green,<br />     And 'tis a magnificent sight to see, on a fine summer afternoon<br />     The bees extracting honey from the leaves when in full bloom.</p>        <p>There the tourist can enjoy himself and while away the hours,<br />     Underneath the lime trees shady bowers,<br />     And listen to the humming of the busy bees,<br />     While they are busy gathering honey from the lime trees.</p>        <p>Then there's the old burying ground near by Kinross,<br />     And the dead that lie there turned into dusty dross,<br />     And the gravestones are all in a state of decay,<br />     And the wall around it is mouldering away.</p></blockquote><br /><br /><script type="text/javascript"><br />var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?

Whether it's trains, queens or lochs, he succeeds in ending his poems with a death theme. Macabre achievements aside, he is right of course about the scenery. It deserves a magnificent poem. Bring it on.</div>

Mr McGonagall's understanding of pollination is interesting: "The bees extracting honey from the LEAVES when in full bloom."</div>
