Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><br />Ouch.</div>

Pure joy. Not something that comes automatically - when do we ever rejoice in trials? I know that I too often forget that the words I read in the Word actually apply to real life. <br />Single-mindedness. They call it narrow-mindedness out there. But how else can we live, if we can&#39;t stick to one purpose - becoming more like Jesus? Waves of the sea, chaff that the wind blows away...<br />It is a challenge, praying with purpose and without doubt. Bless you, brother.</div>
