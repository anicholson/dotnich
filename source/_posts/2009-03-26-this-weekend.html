<div class='post'>
…I will be back in Adelaide for the first time since I left there at the end of 2008. I'll be there for the Equip Conference, a Christian training event run by the <a href="http://efac.org.au/">Evangelical Fellowship of Anglican Churches</a>.<br /><br />I'm a little apprehensive about going back, as coming back to Melbourne from overseas made me feel almost as if I'd never left (being so busy didn't hurt, either, of course :) I don't know why this suddenly comes at me; it happened just before I left Adelaide to come back to Melbourne after Christmas.<br /><br />Whatever the case, it's bound to be a valuable weekend of sound teaching and great training, and a chance to see some old new friends for the first time in a while :)</div>
