# Portfolio &amp; Projects

Here's a selection of things I have either built or am building - whether software or not!

## Pain <i class='icon-ruby'></i>

I read Daniel Cook's article "Improving Bug Triage with User Pain", and found it very helpful.
I decided to knock up a quick CLI tool that I could use to score bugs for my projects quickly and simply :)

## Mining Depot <i class='icon-ruby'></i>

Ever since auditing a subject on concurrency at University, I've wanted to build something that was threaded from the ground up. Since most of my work right now is Web-based, I don't get many opportunities to learn about threading! So I'm building this to learn how to build portable, thread-safe &amp; highly-concurrent code in Ruby.

## Mining Frontends <i class='icon-ruby'></i> <i class='icon-javascript'></i>

The next logical step for the Mining Depot project. Given a portable Ruby application that isn't tied to a hosting or distribution model, how many different frontends can I build for the exact same application?

Ideas for frontends:

* Command-line, curses-style
* 2D graphics with gosu
* browser client with API calls
