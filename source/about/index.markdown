Hi! I'm a 28-year-old software developer from Melbourne, Australia. Call me Andy :)

I pick up new languages, concepts, and technologies quickly. My career so far has called on me to learn and use PHP, Python, and Javascript, but right now I mostly write code in Ruby. I thrive in the gap between the problem space and the solution. I'm warm and friendly, and easy to get along with.

3) I'm known for taking an idea and picking it to pieces. I have a knack for asking the right questions, and then thinking of the right answers.

4) Hitwise, Locomote, CoreMind, Messagexchange.

5) I believe in good UX, elegant design, and clean, well-written code. I believe that I am a "Terrible Programmer", and this helps me critique what I build.

6)

7) When I'm not working, I enjoy poking around old record shops, or tackling the cryptic crossword in the newspaper with my wife. I love food and drink that's made with care - but beer and coffee are my true loves, beveragely-speaking.

8) I have been interested in technology since childhood (XT, 386), and people since becoming an adult.

9) I grew up in Brisbane, when good coffee was "Nescafe Gold" and international cuisine was from the Chinese Takeaway down the road. It's a different city now, but I don't regret moving to Melbourne with my family in 2003.

10) I love my church, and I play piano there in one of the bands. I also play harmonica, and am teaching myself to play this strange contraption!
