<p>While getting the <a href="http://blog.cogent.co/">Cogent Blog</a> up and running recently, I ran into a strange issue with the <a href="http://ghost.io/">Ghost</a> blogging platform and WebFonts - hopefully this will save you some pain.</p>

<p>We use a couple custom fonts on the blog, defining them using the CSS<wbr><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face"><code>@font-face directives</code></a>. One font was worked fine, but the other consistently failed to show up.</p>

<h1>What the WOFF?</h1>

<p>For the font that didn&rsquo;t work, the browser received a 303 redirect to the same URI, but with a trailing slash. The font that worked was served just fine.</p>

<p>It turned out the &ldquo;broken&rdquo; font was in WOFF format, and the one that worked was in WOFF2 format. This wouldn&rsquo;t normally make any difference, but something was definitely odd. Our blog is hosted on <a href="http://ghost.io/">Ghost.io</a> too, so troubleshooting options were limited.</p>

<h1>Tricksy MIME Types</h1>

<p>The <s>solution</s> workaround turned out to be really simple:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rename the broken font&rsquo;s extension from <strong><code>.woff</code></strong> to <strong><code>.woff2</code></strong>, and fix the paths in the CSS.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly why this works. Maybe it&rsquo;s to do with Ghost&rsquo;s routing rules – or maybe it&rsquo;s the fault of Ghost&rsquo;s CDN. Either way, hopefully this solves you some head-scratching if your fonts aren&rsquo;t working as you expect.</p>
