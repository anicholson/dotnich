We've had a few weeks without studies since the last update, what with a scheduled break and the mid-semester "holiday". There've been a couple of studies in that time, though, so apologies for being a bit behind.<br /><br />First one is by Jeff, an introductory look at the highly controversial topic of gender roles (especially inside the church). <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/Gender%20Roles%20Study%20%26%20notes.zip">Study + Notes [ZIP]</a><br /><br />The second one is one I took on Leadership in the Church, and Paul's teachings on the sorts of leaders churches deserve to have. <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/Qualifications.pdf">Study [PDF]</a><br /><br />I hope these provoke questions and thoughts as you go through them :)<br /><br />EDIT: Oops, Jeff's study notes are in a zip file, not a PDF. Fixed...</div>

Thanks for taking the time to post these studies during your busy month. The studies are fabulous. They give clear guidance on a wide range of specifics. Yet their very clarity jars on some people...I suppose the verses insist we expose our position on Authority of Scripture, because they don&#39;t leave much grey area to hide in :)  Some respond by demanding we change scripture&#39;s view to match our modernity, rather than change ourselves to match scripture. Yet time and again, and without exception in the long-term, churches and families living under the Word bear the good fruit. I&#39;m confident that as the Word continues to be faithfully taught, the truth will defend itself in the outworkings of the lives of those following it. This gives us much challenge to rise to. I have to work on the QUIET part at times :)  Yet I take my hat off to you BLOKES... study #2 indicates you have the lion&#39;s share of the challenge. I pray you&#39;ll keep up the great work; the rest of us need, value &amp; depend on your Godly male leadership. Thanks again Andrew for the post...</div>

We're back from a scheduled break for just catching up, hanging out, and getting the low-down on how each other was getting on with life, study, etc.<div><br /></div><div>This week, Paul takes a time-out from teaching Timothy to give thanks and praise to God for the grace He has given to him. He thinks about the implications of this, and we learn from his response.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /><br /><a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/1_Tim_1_12-17.pdf">Week 4: Thank God for Grace!

It is sometimes portrayed as being a necessary evil, something that Jesus destroyed for us.  But is this really the case? Check out the study and see for yourself!<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/Wk%202%20-%20Law_and_Freedom.pdf">Week 2: Law and Freedom [PDF]</a><br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Creative Commons: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/umjanedoan/496720501/in/set-72157600210903155">umjanedoan on flickr</a></span></div>

I know earlier in the year I promised I'd put up the Bible Studies I was taking with Jeff for CU, but these never really eventuated. Sorry!<br /><br />This semester hopefully will be different :)<br /><br /><br />Jeff Reddan & myself are conducting Bible Studies on Paul's first letter to Timothy, on Tuesday afternoons. We've got roughly 5 people or so that have said they can come (although we've not yet had them all at once!), and it promises to be a really great time.<br /><br />Here's the first study as led by Jeff:<br /><br /><a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/Wk1%20-%20False%20Teaching.pdf">Week 1: False Teaching [PDF]</a><br /><br />UPDATE: Jeff's provided me with some more material for this study. <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/175757/CU%20Bible%20Studies/False%20Teaching%20notes.zip">[ZIP]</a></div>

Had a look at the week 1 slides... you guys are pretty organised! Looks great. I&#39;m a little annoyed I have a class which clashes with your study; otherwise I&#39;d come along.</div>

One of the things I'm doing as part of my involvement with <a href="http://www.swinburnecu.org/">Swinburne Christian Union</a> this year is co-leading a Bible Study on Monday mornings. I hope to post a more fleshed-out version of what I'll be going through each fortnight on the Monday or Tuesday after I've taken the study. First one is this week, hope it goes smoothly.<br /><br />Now, to actually finish writing itâ€¦</div>
