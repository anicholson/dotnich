<h1>…in 50 words or less</h1>

<p>We’re growing up, Ruby community – but it’s okay! Ruby isn’t great just because it’s new, so let’s not freak out when other New Hotnesses™ come. If we <a href="#on_the_shoulders_of_giants">learn from those who’ve come before</a>, <a href="#embrace_new_ideas">embrace new ideas</a>, and <a href="#diversity">welcome new &amp; different voices</a>, we’ll both <a href="#do_all_the_cool_things">survive and thrive</a>!</p>

<h1>…the talks!</h1>

<p>I only attended the talks, so I can’t comment on the workshops, although every attendee I spoke to enjoyed them. The 2 days of talks only had the single track, but I think they fell neatly into a few distinct categories. Here are my highlights from each :) <s>They will be available on <a href="http://eventer.com/">Eventer</a> soon, so I’ll update these with links when that happens.</s></p>

<p><strong>Update: The talks are now available, so <a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223">go and watch them all!</a></strong></p>

<h2><a name="on_the_shoulders_of_giants"></a>“Hey, there’s all this stuff people have known for a while!”</h2>

<p>As Ruby &amp; Rails get older, we’re using it to solve bigger problems (good!) and deal with <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritchian abominations</a> created by past us (bad!).</p>

<h3><a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/loving-legacy-code-by-keith-pitty-1718">Loving Legacy Code – Keith Pitty</a></h3>

<p>Got an old, hairy codebase to look after? Keith has some gentle suggestions for getting along with it.</p>

<p>or, How Neither <em>Thomas the Tank Engine</em> Nor Plus Sizes Are The Answer.</p>

<h3><a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/pre-factoring-getting-it-closer-to-right-the-first-time-by-coraline-ada-ehmke-1726">Prefactoring: Getting it (Closer to) Right the First Time – Coraline Ada Ehmke</a> &amp; <a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/service-oriented-disasters-by-rachel-myers-1732">Service-Oriented Disasters – Rachel Meyers</a></h3>

<p>Two great talks on traps &amp; pitfalls to avoid when breaking apps into smaller pieces. The highlights of a strong SOA tinge through the technical talks.</p>

<h2><a name="do_all_the_cool_things"></a>“What cool things are Ruby people doing now?”</h2>

<p>Like refreshing palate cleansers on a degustation menu, these were sprinkled through at just the right times. Real cool things being done by real cool people.</p>

<h3><a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/principles-of-play-by-linda-liukas-1717">Principles of Play – Linda Liukas</a></h3>

<p>This was a wonderful talk. Children are great because they haven’t learned about what they “shouldn’t do” yet. I will be <a href="http://www.helloruby.com/">buying her book</a> when I become a Dad, regardless of whether I have a son or a daughter :)</p>

<p>Big world problems don’t <em>only</em> need big solutions. Sometimes little projects can be a big help in themselves. Sean used Raspberry Pis and Ruby to give the plight of honeybees a voice.</p>

<h3><a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/programming-as-performance-by-joseph-wilk-1733">Programming as Performance – Joseph Wilks</a></h3>

<p>Live coding can be just as compelling as any other live art form. Joseph gave us a peek into the tools that exist for live coding music, and then gave a stunning demo of what’s possible with Clojure + Emacs.</p>

<p><img src='http://andrewdotni.ch//images/repl_electric.jpg' /></p>

<h2><a name="embrace_new_ideas"></a>“What new stuff could make Ruby better?”</h2>

<p>A great mixture of humanity, high–level maths, and where our language might go in future.</p>

<p>Plato, Process Philosophy, and a gentle prod to look outside our own bubble. Presented from a Moleskine, because hipster NY :)</p>

<h3><a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/consider-static-typing-by-tom-stuart-1720">Consider Static Typing – Tom Stuart</a></h3>

<p>Ruby’s dynamically typed, and attracts people who like dynamic typing. Tom wonders whether we can’t have our cake and eat it too?</p>

<h3><a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/towards-a-higher-level-language-by-erik-michaels-ober-1746">Towards a Higher-Level Language – Erik Michaels-Ober</a></h3>

<p>Ruby’s a very high-level language. But while people are trying to “make a <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">better</a> <a href="http://golang.org/">C</a> or <a href="http://clojure.org/">Lisp</a>”, nobody’s really trying to build a better Ruby. Why not?</p>

<h2><a name=“diversity”></a>“How can we be make ‘us’ better?”</h2>

<p>We can and should become more rounded individuals, and there are lots of paths! Trying more things, listening to others and stepping out of our comfort zones will all get us there.</p>

<p>Startups are hard. Build side projects instead. <em>Present You</em> won’t be under so much pressure, and <em>Future You</em> will have a richer set of experiences to draw on. Plus side projects don’t have to justify their existence!</p>

<h3><a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/understanding-despair-by-john-dalton-1736">Understanding Despair – John Dalton</a></h3>

<p>A great talk on depression, and how we still suck at talking about it, understanding it, and giving ourselves a break.</p>

<h3><a href="https://rubyconf.eventer.com/rubyconf-australia-2015-1223/on-second-acts-by-john-barton-1727">On Second Acts – John Barton</a></h3>

<p>or, You Can Do Post-Technical Things (and doing them will help the entire Ruby community). A call to arms for the more senior members of the community: If some of us who understand the benefits of Ruby don’t move into management, we’ll get managers who don’t and the community will suffer.</p>

<h1>Other Observations</h1>

<p><img src='http://andrewdotni.ch//images/picnic.jpg' /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I loved the venue – the Edge Theatre is a stunning place and so central to everything! The only downside is that it only allowed for a single conference track. A few people were disappointed that there weren’t more “Ruby-centric” talks, and a single track probably explains most of why.</p></li>
<li><p>I liked the diversity of Social Activities. The organisers deliberately recognised that not everyone likes to go drinking at the end of every day. I thought the balance of other activities they provided catered for lots of different tastes. Well done!</p></li>
<li><p>I was pleased to meet a few <em>new</em> Rubyists at the conference. I feel like I’ve been on the fringes of the community for ages, and haven’t quite known how to “break in”, as it were. Meeting new recruits to our community gave me a chance to pay that welcome forward.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you made it this far, well done. The conference was great, and Rubyists of any level should go next year and make it even better.</p>

    <link href="http://andrewdotni.ch//blog/2014/12/12/aah14-waleed-aly/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-12T11:48:35+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://andrewdotni.ch//blog/2014/12/12/aah14-waleed-aly</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>AAH14 Keynote - Waleed Aly: Ethics &amp; Technology</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waleed_Aly">Waleed Aly</a> considered himself a strange guest speaker for a tech conference, given his background in journalism, political science &amp; law. I disagree, though - especially for a conference focusing on humanity.</p>

<p>He challenged us to think about the ethics of the space we’re working in at both micro and macro levels, and used philosophy as a backdrop for the conversation.</p>

<p>The world of philosophy is often ignored, but it provides invaluable questions of “Why?” and “Should?” that engineering, as a “How?” discipline, simply cannot.</p>

<h3>micro</h3>

<p>Q: “Are there inherent ethical challenges to the technology I’m working on?” is a question we don’t ask ourselves enough. The tech sector has a tendency to focus on what is possible first, then work out whether we should afterwards (usually after it’s too late and we’ve already done it).</p>

<p>Take (as Waleed did) driverless cars. He transposed them into the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">“Trolley Problem”</a> - where split-second decisions have moral questions. We afford ourselves a certain slack because in that situation it’s hard to know what we would choose. What about a machine, that by definition has to be told how to think? How should <em>it</em> answer the question? Even as technologists, ethics problems are <em>our</em> problems.</p>

<h3>macro, or the myth of “neutral technology”</h3>

<p>Q: Why do we tell ourselves technology is “neutral”, when it so often ends up causing changes for good and bad?</p>

<p>The introduction of the car changed forever the notion of the city. Television changed forever the notion of mass communication.</p>

<p>We tell ourselves that our technological changes (new platforms new media) are neutral - or at least that the net good will outweigh the bad. Why do we do this?</p>

<p>We talk about “the death of print” in the news industry, and assert that journalistic standards shouldn’t change. But how could we assume that standards wouldn’t change when new technology allows us to optimise speed over accuracy like never before?</p>

<p>We build drones, and drones that can wage war without people present. But what would war look like when attackers needn’t fear loss of their own life? Would they be more aggressive and kill more people? Or would they save lives by being more precise?</p>

<p>Waleed suggested that the tech industry perhaps unsurprisingly has more progressively-minded people in it than conservatively-minded. If we recognised that, perhaps we would make better-informed decisions about the social impacts our technological decisions might have.</p>

<h3>aside: Technology &amp; Worldview</h3>

<p>During Waleed’s Q&amp;A, someone asked questions as “a self-confessed ethics n00b.”. He worried the ethical conversations ended up being a waste of time because he left with more questions than answers!</p>

<p>That fascinated me, because we like to pretend we make decisions in a vacuum, or guided by “reason, science, facts, etc.” And, to an extent, we all do.</p>

<p>But we also see every fact, every piece of information through lenses, or worldviews. To deny that is the very essence of cognitive bias!</p>

<p>How could we, as people working in a quickly-changing industry, incorporate more mindfulness of our worldviews into what we do?</p>

    <link href="http://andrewdotni.ch//blog/2014/12/12/above-all-human-2014/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-12T10:39:16+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://andrewdotni.ch//blog/2014/12/12/above-all-human-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week I got the opportunity to attend the inaugural <a href="http://aboveallhuman.co/">Above All Human</a> conference, held in North Melbourne’s Arts House Meat Market. Here are some thoughts &amp; reflections I took out of it.</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<ul>
<li>There are lots of conversations we’re not having as an industry. Ethics, diversity and responsibility often end up subservient to pragmatism, profit, and monoculture.</li>
<li>“Solving a problem” is a very broad statement. Some people’s problems are finding shoes that fit; others are finding capital to finance their businesses in places with no banking infrastructure. Others just want to find cool links on the Internet.</li>
<li>Just because people are internet-famous and can start cool businesses, doesn’t guarantee that they have insight to share.</li>
<li>Listen to people who are not like yourself, and you will learn.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/@bronwen/what-are-you-going-to-do-with-your-beautiful-fragile-life-4ce679c25b40">Bronwen &amp; Susan’s opening remarks</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Morning keynotes</strong> Perhaps I was just more awake in the morning, but I felt it was the best part. The morning keynote-ish talks were awesome, and I’ll give them some air time of their own.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23aah14">#aah14</a></strong> The conversations happening on twitter were amazing, and having MC <a href="https://twitter.com/mpesce">@mpesce</a> actively participating helped those back-channel interactions feed back into the main show.</p>

<p><strong>Diversity of speakers</strong> One of the organisers’ stated goals was to have a diverse lineup, across genders &amp; cultures. I think they did a great job of that. The only piece missing were older people. There is a wealth of wisdom in the older voices in tech that would have been great to see there.</p>

<p><strong>The venue</strong> all the tech conferences I’ve attended in Melbourne have been, sadly, a touch on the bland side. But the Meat Market was a great venue, and the mingling space outside the auditorium was a fun place to hang out, chat, and get refueled.</p>

<h2>Lowlights</h2>

<p><strong>VC panel</strong> I was really interested in the questions being asked of the VC guests - about diversity in VC funding, approaches Australian companies can take in a smaller pond of money, and why an “exit” is pretty much the only strategy VC seems to be interested in.</p>

<p>Their answers? “I’ll fund what appeals to me”, “maybe you <strong>should</strong> just go to the Valley”, and “because 1000x, duh”.</p>

<p>A sad irony that those keen to invest in “innovation”, etc. feel no need (or interest) to innovate their own practices. What would disrupting the VC space look like?</p>

<p><strong>YC Office Hours</strong> This was a strange segment - designed to mimic the YC pitching sessions, but on stage in front of an audience. It felt a bit like free advertising for YCombinator, and (even more oddly) most of the pitching companies didn’t seem that interested in their advice anyway. If I’d made any of those companies I suppose I’d be defensive of my baby too - but it made for a strange (voyeuristic?) experience.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/bronwen">Bronwen</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/sw">Susan</a> for organising a wonderful conference. We need more of these conversations in our industry. Well done &amp; see you next year!</p>
