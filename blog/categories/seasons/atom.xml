"Be still," the Voice said.<br />"Be still? Are you kidding?" I thought.<br /><br />I've got to get my<br />my views opined<br />doctrines aligned<br />vices maligned<br />sins disinclined<br /><br />My style designed<br />life plan outlined<br />hobbies defined<br />a wife to find<br />that You've assigned somewhere, presumably<br /><br />and bear in mind<br />I've got the daily grind<br />sucks out the zest, the lemon rind<br />of life that comes and perks the mind<br /><br />and all of these combined<br />just serve to take my bind<br />and wind it up<br />so this is why like most mankind<br />I'm disinclined<br />to lie inclined<br />and listen to<br />Your still, small Voice.</div>

Beautiful Summer now hath fled,<br />And the face of Nature doth seem dead,<br />And the leaves are withered, and falling off the trees,<br />By the nipping and chilling autumnal breeze.<br /><br />The pleasures of the little birds are all fled,<br />And with the cold many of them will be found dead,<br />Because the leaves of the trees are scattered in the blast,<br />And makes the feathered creatures feel downcast.<br /><br />Because there are no leaves on the trees to shield them from the storm<br />On a windy, and rainy, cloudy morn;<br />Which makes their little hearts throb with pain,<br />By the chilling blast and the pitiless rain.<br /><br />But still they are more contented than the children of God,<br />As long as they can pick up a worm from the sod,<br />Or anything they can get to eat,<br />Just, for instance, a stale crust of bread or a grain of wheat.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the little birds in the time of the snow,<br />Also of the little street waifs, that are driven to and fro,<br />And trembling in the cold blast, and chilled to the bone,<br />For the want of food and clothing, and a warm home.<br /><br />Besides think of the sorrows of the wandering poor,<br />That are wandering in the cold blast from door to door;<br />And begging, for Heaven's sake, a crust of bread,<br />And alas! Not knowing where to lay their head.<br /><br />While the rich are well fed and covered from the cold,<br />While the poor are starving, both young and old;<br />Alas! It is the case in this boasted Christian land,<br />Where as the rich are told to be kind to the poor, is God's command.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the working man when he's no work to do,<br />Who's got a wife and family, perhaps four or two,<br />And the father searching for work, and no work can be had,<br />The thought, I'm sure, 'tis enough to drive the poor man mad.<br /><br />Because for his wife and family he must feel,<br />And perhaps the thought thereof will cause him to steal<br />Bread for his family, that are starving at home,<br />While the thought thereof makes him sigh heavily and groan.<br /><br />Alas! The pangs of hunger are very hard to hide,<br />And few people can their temper control,<br />Or become reconciled to their fate,<br />Especially when they cannot find anything to eat.<br /><br />Oh! Think of the struggles of the poor to make a living,<br />Because the rich unto them seldom are giving;<br />Wereas they are told he that giveth to the poor lendeth unto the Lord,<br />But alas! they rather incline their money to hoard.<br /><br />Then theres the little news-vendors in the street,<br />Running about perhaps with bare feet;<br />And if the rich chance to see such creatures in the street,<br />In general they make a sudden retreat.<br /></blockquote><br /><hr /><span style="font-size:85%;"><br />Photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deniscollette/1582876153/">Denis Collette on Flickr</a>.</span></div>

More than a poet. He's a revolutionary. All pea-throwers owe this man an apology.</div>
